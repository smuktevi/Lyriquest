# LyriQuest  [Prototype]
Our project aims at enhancing the experience for sound cataloguing by employing methods to further classify music as well as giving a description about the lyrics. People listen to music in order to feel certain emotions and express joy and sadness. Sometimes people want to listen to sad songs but at other times they want to listen to happy music. This application will help users select music based on their mood. 
 
The software uses various modules to fulfill the operating requirements. It employs the help of song fingerprinting, machine learning, and data science in order to recommend songs, draw graphs, and give analysis on the type of music a person listens to.  
 
The user will be able to find out more information about known and unknown songs rather than just looking at the title. Users will have access to a quick description about the topics and emotions in a song so that they can make a quick judgment on whether to include the track on their playlist. This approach can also help already existing playlist generation machines improve accuracy and create better recommendations.
