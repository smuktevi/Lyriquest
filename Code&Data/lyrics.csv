Within Temptation,And We Run,/w/within+temptation/and+we+run_21076802.html,"It burns into your heart, the darkness that you fear  
You were never free, and you never realized  
And love, is a word you've never heard  
Your heart is cold cause it burns, the desire to leave the mind  
  
Take your breath til nothing's left  
Stars of life upon your chest  
And I know you wherever you go  
  
And we run and we don't look back  
And we run til we've had enough  
And we run, tell me how to run  
And we run, til we break down  
And we run til we fall apart  
And we run til we've had enough  
  
Don't blink, you'll miss it  
Lift up your head. We gotta get gone  
Yeah, we outta here  
Don't blink, you'll miss it  
Lift up your head  
Too late, we gone  
Yeah, we outta here  
  
And we run, for this killing love  
And we run, tell me how it's enough  
And we run, far ahead we go  
  
I'ma break these chains, ran through the rain  
Never looked back, never quit, worked through the pain  
This blood in my veins run cold when I hate  
Give enough to keep sane but I never lose hope  
This is my time now, no time for tears to celebrate  
Put it in the air right now  
Never back down, you'll never wear my crown  
cause it weighs too much and I crush every motherfucking thing I touch  
This is what I've never loved so much  
Get involved what's the worst stand up  
Here my mic before I ever get far  
Man in lights, you lost all my trust  
Now it's time to face all of us  
Get in line just to spar with us  
And it feels so far from us, just take my hand and run  
  
And we run, for this killing love  
And we run, tell me how it's enough  
And we run, til we never don  
And we run til we fall apart  
And we run, til it's enough  
  
Yeah, we out of here  
  
Don't blink, you'll miss it  
Lift up your head  
We gotta get gone  
Yeah, we outta here  
Don't blink, you'll miss it  
Lift up your head  
Too late, we gone  
Yeah, we outta here  
  
And we run, for this killing love  
And we run, tell me how it's enough  
And we run, til we never don  
And we run til we fall apart  
And we run, til it's enough  
  
Don't blink, you'll miss it  
Lift up your head  
We gotta get gone  
Yeah, we outta here  
Don't blink, you'll miss it  
Lift up your head  
Too late, we gone  
Yeah, we outta here

Within Temptation,Candles,/w/within+temptation/candles_10188442.html,"Take away,  
these hands of darkness.  
Reaching for my soul.  
Now, the cold wind  
blows out my candles.  
Feeling,  
only fear,  
without any hope.  
  
A thousand dark moons.  
A thousand winters long.  
A million fallen stars,  
the candle burns in the womb  
  
We try not to forget,  
they live through us.  
Slowly they die away at every candle's end  
  
A thousand dark moons,  
A thousand winters long.  
A million fallen stars,  
the candle burns in the womb.

Within Temptation,Dark Wings,/w/within+temptation/dark+wings_10188450.html,"Why was I one of the chosen ones  
Until the fight I could not see  
The magic and the strength of my power  
It was beyond my wildest dreams  
  
Dark wings they are descending  
See shadows gathering around  
One by one they are falling  
Every time they try to strike us down  
  
Don't you die on me  
You haven't made your peace  
Live life, breathe, breathe  
Don't you die on me  
You haven't made your peace  
Live life, breathe, breathe  
  
Dark wings they are descending  
See shadows gathering around  
One by one they are falling  
Every time they try to strike us down  
  
(Ah...)  
  
As they took your soul away  
The night turned into the day  
Blinded by your rays of life  
Gave us the strength we needed  
  
Dark wings they are descending  
See shadows gathering around  
One by one they are falling  
Every time they try to strike us down  
Dark wings they are descending  
See shadows gathering around  
One by one they are falling  
Every time they try to strike us down

Within Temptation,Deceiver Of Fools,/w/within+temptation/deceiver+of+fools_20180058.html,"He feeds on fear  
He feeds on hate  
He rules again  
With growing hate  
He will gain their faith again  
Light in the darkness is too small to see  
There's always a sparkle of hope  
If you just believe  
  
He told the tale so many times  
About the dream not meant to be  
In the world of the free  
He plays with your mind  
As faith for the future faded fast  
He grows strong with their displeasure  
It sets him free  
  
Deceiver of hearts  
Deceiver of fools  
He rules with fear  
Deceiver of hearts  
Deceiver of fools  
He rules again  
  
He feeds on fear  
Poisons the truth  
To gain their faith  
To lead the way  
To a world of decay  
  
He rules your heart  
He will sell your soul to the grave  
Without a hesitation to make  
He belongs to the dark  
  
Please awake  
And see the truth  
He can only be  
If you believe what he tells you  
Remember who you are  
What you stand for  
And there will always be a way  
  
In my heart there is a place  
In my heart there is a trace  
Of a small fire burning  
A sheltering ray shines through this night  
Although it's small, it's bright  
But darkness is lurking  
He will sell your soul to bitterness and cold  
All fear him  
  
Deceiver of hearts  
Deceiver of fools  
He rules with fear  
Deceiver of hearts  
Deceiver of fools  
Shall he rule again?

Somehow you're only able to see  
All I am not  
Did you ever look behind?  
Aren't you afraid of the pieces you'll find?  
I have failed you  
But you have failed me too  
It's so easy to destroy and condemn  
The ones you do not understand  
Do you ever wonder if it's justified?  
It's so easy to destroy and condemn  
The ones you do not understand  
In your life, why didn't you ever try?  
I close my eyes as I walk the thin line  
Between love and hate  
For the person with the same blood  
In his veins  
You show no regrets  
About all the things you did or said  
I have failed you  
But believe me you failed me too  
It's so easy to destroy and condemn  
The ones you do not understand  
Do you ever wonder if it's justified?  
It's so easy to destroy and condemn  
The ones you do not understand  
In your life, why didn't you ever try?

While we thought we were gaining,  
we would turn back the tide, it still slips away.  
Our time has run out, our future has died,  
there's no more escape.  
  
Now the day has come,  
we are forsaken,  
there's no time anymore.  
Life will pass us by,  
we are forsaken,

We tried to hide what we feared inside.

A fight to stand up  
Memory still haunts me  
In the dead of night  
Over and over, I felt so small  
But one day I'll be stronger  
And you better watch out  
I will overcome, your violence their silence  
Although it can't be undone  
I will overcome, knowing that I'm not the only one  
I will overcome, it's the only way to carry on  
Where are the saviors?  
Afraid of the toll  
Sorry, do my nine inch nails  
Slash your soul  
Such heroes  
Throwing stones  
Straight at the one  
Who is standing alone  
Twisting and turning  
It's always the same  
Truth is never honest  
When you're to blame  
Pushing and pulling  
Never give in, one day I wish  
You'll see you're not so beautiful within  
I will overcome, our violence your silence  
Although it can't be undone  
I will overcome, knowing that I'm not the only one  
I will overcome, it's the only way to carry on  
Run and run  
Run and run  
I will overcome, their violence your silence  
Although it can't be undone  
I will overcome, knowing that I'm not the only one  
I will overcome, it's the only way to carry on  
I will overcome

Even Judas knew he had lied  
  
I keep wondering why  
I'm still calling your name through my tears  
  
Why have you waited to embrace me my dear?  
Cold is your silence, denying what is real  
I'm still wondering why  
I'm still calling your name my dear  
  
I'm sorry if you can't stand the naked truth  
All you see is how you want it to be  
So you keep on living your life  
  
Release me from this cross after all these years  
Oh call my name and help me with this weight  
Even though it comes far too late  
  
I keep wondering why  
I'm still calling your name through my tears  
  
Why have you waited to embrace me my dear  
Cold is your silence, denying what is real  
I'm still wondering why I'm still calling your name  
And I wonder, oh I wonder ...  
  
In my heart I still hope you will open the door  
You can purify it all, answer my call  
  
Why? Why?  
  
Why have you waited to embrace me my dear?  
Cold is your silence, denying what is real  
I'm still wondering why I'm still calling your name

So I'm a spread my wings and head for the sky  
And I fly solo  
And I fly solo  
And I fly solo  
And I fly solo  
And I  
  
I had a dream that the whole world was staring at me  
I woke up and wasn't no one there  
Wasn't no one there  
Yeah eh 'eah

We don't even count the money no more we just blow it  
(We spend it all up)  
We don't even count the money no more we just throw it  
And make 'em pick it all up  
  
Money strapped to my waist  
Somewhere in the whip I'm in with no bass  
Flooded the trap I need a new place?  
Money got to go I told 'em there's no space  
Never love hoes, hoes I don't chase  
Only wear loc's the same as my race  
All I know is stunt, make a hater feel like shit to the point  
That he in another place? Real talk  
I-I-I ain't the one but I lean on haters, looking so clean on gator  
Try to jack me, I guarantee I'll put the beam on haters  
Hood nigga, when I come to this I'm stocked up  
Shit on my wrist tryna light this block up  
Nigga said I got a dope man swag, take a look at these jewels  
Every one of 'em rocked up  
And we still on the corner packed in  
Ace town president somethin' back then  
Hope the slut that I'm with got insurance so  
She know I'm about to run up on her back end  
Like I set of bad, she was gettin' plugged  
Can take it to the streets, take it to the club  
I don't rubber band shit I got trash bags  
Niggas make it rain, I'ma make it flood  
I ain't gonna talk shit I'ma talk bread  
I f a hater don't like it, tell 'em drop dead  
I'm in the hood like a fresh set of projects  
Where they either rock blue or they rock red  
I'm the king of the streets  
Ain't nobody finna take away what I came to get  
Audi R8 that I came is sick, with interior the color of a all white?

Big weed in my joint, diss me there's no point  
Lil guy but still all my n-ggas got big heat they on point  
Rollin up while I drive, engine be in the trunk  
Decided in 2005 that I can fuck any bitch that I want  
Ooh, and, and and I ain't trying to stunt  
This a two seater my bitch can't help but ride up in the front  
Ballin' most n-ggas wont try to pick 'em up  
Throwin' so much money you even try to pick some up  
You tryin' different stuff look at how I block 'em out  
Smoke like a Cali nigga even when I'm in the south  
And when when my car come out the whores come out  
Don't even get on twitter no more  
'cause I'm what your bitch talkin' 'bout

In my ride, doin' 80 in a 45 Zone, half a zone  
Got me blown, I get more than high  
  
Fresh off of the plane  
Head straight into my hotel  
Weed man in every city, yeah I smoke well (even when I'm gone)  
  
I ain't the only one, all my niggas puff pounds  
Swingin' blunts 'round, sun up 'till sun down

Wit no metal to waist  
I flow great  
And that'll level ya face  
But I'll still let a nigga have it  
You talk greasy but you still a fagot  
I front on cowards cause you niggas backwards  
I got my money right  
Game on top  
And it's been said that I'm the key to put this game on lock  
I'm from the city  
Of the triflin' hoods  
But when you see me  
Gotta smile on my face  
Nothin' sweet, it's just that life is good  
Yea, I dodged the hood  
Slums came up out that  
Rap game about that  
To gain pay wit out crack  
See Imma youngin' wit' too much on my plate  
To let some small change have a youngin' dumped in a cage  
I seen niggas make sells  
Niggas get knocked and make bail  
And take lives, they worries ain't jail  
Wit no regards for life cause they livin' ain't well  
Who gotta make it to heaven cause they livin' in hell  
But me I don't do much just keep to myself  
And stop these cock-suckin' motha-fuckas seekin' my wealth  
I was told the world's cold but I see for my self  
And I'm too hot to take the back seat or the shelf  
So I'm here  
For sum reason though they hate it to death  
The love's gone only hatred is left  
Only achin' and stress  
A king not be mistaken for less  
And this here is for the taking  
This is history in the making  
  
Where I'm from it's kinda hard to trust  
Cause the hate's from most of your own people  
They're fake and they're all see through  
Hate to see a nigga when he's stackin' his bucks  
Rather him be down in the dumps  
And out on his luck  
But I'll be damned if my grind stop  
My mind tickin' like the time watch  
And I'm gon be spittin' 'till the time's not  
Presently there  
I touch minds everywhere  
And I'll ride hopin' heaven is near  
See the pain in your eyes young wit every stare  
I seek peace, but these streets will never be fair  
Cause somebody went and took Greg's life  
Son reached  
Deceased  
No time to blink or think twice damn  
Wonder when it gonna be my time  
To meet death  
I'm stressed need to ease my mind  
And unless one of y'all try to see whats mine  
Then I'll eat through your flesh, bones and leave that spine  
U see I did the right thing  
I stayed up out the gun and knife game  
I knew about the pain it might bring  
And we all got problems  
I chose to smoke blunts just to drown 'em  
The top, but I rose from the bottom  
And I'm here now  
Ain't no body harming young  
My screw's loose they say somethings wrong wit young  
Ya time's up I'm just warning young  
Cause this here's for the taking,  
This is history in the making

Watch her hit tha flo', I'm out here spending all this paper  
Bought some cigarillos yeah I blow it by the acre  
If you lookin' this good well shit I wanna meet your maker  
Take her to my home, Say hello to my neighbors  
She my biggest fan, I see her man just trying to save her  
Put it in her mouth, and yeah my taste she's trying to savor  
Shorty saying Khalifa Man should have his own flavor  
Haters wanna be me, but can't walk in my Chuck Taylor's  
All black eleven's, Mac-11 with the laser  
Mami keep on shaking it like she a salt shaker  
Hand on the ground, everybody around.

A lot of niggas hate, but all the bitches wanna do me  
Wizzle L. Jackson, Yeah my life is like a movie  
Heavy Hustle Gang, Swisher Sweets with the jacuzzi  
Probably fucked your girl, If you don't like it nigga sue me  
Shawty from the hood, but in the club she actin' booshie  
Body like a centerfold, Boy look at that booty  
My ink got her gone, Wanting to know who tattoos me  
Head game right, Just said she'd like to ride (Yeah)  
DJ play my song, When it come on she gets excited  
Before I leave the club, I'll put her number in my sidekick  
Swagger on some different shit, She tell me that she like it  
Watch her break it down, I ain't playin' around.

Let let it go, let it go, let it go  
Let them go, let them go, let them go  
Let them know, let them know, let them know

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa](2x)  
Who trying to make a play  
Who trying to make a play  
Who trying to make a play  
Who trying to make a play  
Woke up drunk as fuck  
Still high from yesterday  
I'm trying to make a play  
I'm trying to make a play  
  
[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]  
Woke up feeling like a star  
Get it in no matter where we are  
She in love with me press buttons up in my car  
My weed smoke hella potent  
Riding and the sunroof open  
Blowing smoke out what they know about  
Being bosses, taking losses  
Pay the cost to fuck that bitch, who got that poke out  
My money ain't slow, got more trees to roll  
Got a son I love to death, I gotta see him grow  
Probably the best you've seen but I be on the low  
Stacking up, rolling marijuana, acting up  
Bitch with me, she be bad as fuck  
Bitches love it, niggas mad at us  
Getting money, that's accurate  
Say they want it but they can't adjust  
Taylor Gang, roll a plane  
  
[Hook](2x)  
  
[Verse 2: J.R. Donato]  
Who trying to pour it(ay, ay)  
Who trying to wake and bake(ay)  
Taylor Gang will break the bank  
Ain't got no time to contemplate  
I say i'm high from yesterday  
Okay i woke up on the mud  
I think i ate a 8th of shrums  
Keep OG Kush up in my lungs(whoa)  
Your hoe will come with us(ay)  
Cause she know we brought the drugs(ay)  
And she looking for some love(ay)  
But let's keep that on the hush(whoa)  
It's hard to find some trust  
Some say it's hard to fuck with us  
That's cause we be on different shit  
Bitch i might pour six up in my Crush  
Ohh that's super super much  
And it's joining super clutch  
Got 5 more just for you to stuff  
Send parents to the store for ice and cups  
I swear they never frighten us  
Hell yeah we always lighting up  
Put that pussy on the plate it's fresh for lunch  
And i pour another 8th to level up  
Probably rolling up

Gettin' higher than the Bee Gee's, sayin' we both just stayin' alive and  
Watchin' the time go by, climbin'  
Told you I did enough hash, to make a mountain  
And you could sit right on your ass, doubtin'  
While I'm somewhere rollin' up grass, going up where the clouds is  
Some niggas say they get so high that I ain't fuckin' wit' 'em  
I say if them niggas get that high man I ain't fuckin' wit' 'em  
Doing nothin' wit' 'em, rollin' up or puffin wit' 'em'  
Goin' on the road, doin' shows or gettin' duckies wit' 'em'  
I been smokin' in my pictures since Myspace  
You niggas extra-curricular, bitch I fly straight  
  
Some niggas try that shit for nothing, but I just tell 'em' to do what they do
(Do what they do)  
So many niggas went down the wrong road, so homie you can too (you can too)  
Just give me weed in my joint and I ain't need it for nothing homie I'm
straight (homie I'm straight)  
The same way I came into the game, If I'm ever going out I'm goin' the same
way  
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug  
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug

Nigga like me be smokin' while I'm rappin'  
And my homies smoke like I smoke so we both just make it happen  
Niggas sayin' they be smokin', they be actin'  
'Cause you ain't yet really smoked unless you smoked one with the captain  
High as fuck, choked up in my cabin  
Got some OG from a fan and it was rolled up in a napkin  
So we Taylored, all my niggas smoke papers  
Never smokin' that bullshit with them fucked up names of them flavors  
I remember puttin' weed in my videos, niggas thought I was insane  
Now every time I turn on a video, I see the exact same thing  
'Cause niggas ain't original, niggas ain't cool  
You niggas ain't got it naw, you niggas just ain't you  
That shit is a problem for a nigga who can't lose  
Lil homie I gotta ball, it's something you can't do  
So suckas hate  
  
Some niggas try that shit for nothing, but I just tell 'em' to do what they do
(Do what they do)  
So many niggas went down the wrong road, so homie you can too (you can too)

I be in the South, trappin' hard all day  
I'm from Pittsburgh, but I be in the Bay  
I be in New York, I be MIA  
I be in Chi-town where they quick to spray  
I be in Detroit where they gettin' paid  
I be overseas, I be in LA  
I be in New York, I be MIA  
  
[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]  
If you know me, you know I'm bout my bread  
I count a hundred million dollars 'fore I go to bed  
I'm smoking OG, I'm drinking champagne  
I'm standing on the couch, just throwing up my damn gang  
I'm out in A town, 'bout to go to Mansion  
My jewelry on so all my dogs is ready for the action  
I'm in my old school, my niggas ridin new  
I'm in the Fountain Bleu like what you tryin' to do  
I brought the whole thing so that's what I'mma smoke  
I spent the whole thing, I'm never going broke  
I'm rocking gold chains, I'm drinking til I croak  
Smokin' 'til I choke, my watch need a vote  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Verse 2: Juicy J]  
On vacation weed in rotation  
Relaxation, trippy nation  
Chasing bands, model chicks  
Look like Sports Illustrated  
I'm getting high as a plane  
With no final destination  
On that gin, on that Hen  
And that lean intoxication  
Rocking dollars, rocking gold  
Money tall like Manute Bol  
In a presidential suite  
With some playmates in a fold  
Niggas out here chasing ass  
When they should be chasing cash  
I be smoking til it's gone  
Juicy J don't waste no gas  
With her legs lift up  
I thought it was a stick up  
Should've seen them hoes that pick up  
Bands hard to lift up  
Yellow diamonds look like a bumble bee  
They call me the money tree  
All these bands on me, I can throw a jamboree  
  
[Hook x2]  
  
[Outro]  
You already know what it is Nigga

Smokin' that loud and still mindin' my business  
She fuck with me because I got the vision  
Countin' my benjis  
Puttin' it all in the bank but I don't really mind if I spend it  
Can't take it? Don't cross the line when you finish  
When you stay all on your grind you can get it  
When we be fuckin' I'm climbin' up in it  
She fuck with me because I got the vision  
Haters be talkin', don't mind 'em, don't listen  
Duckin' 'em shots, that's divine intervention  
I be so high, try me, come visit  
You make a choice, hope you like your decision  
Come to my crib, we can spark and get lifted  
Go up in smoke just like I'm a magician  
Ain't fuck with me then she probably was trippin'  
Lightin' 'em up just like we electricians  
Get to this money, get high, my intentions  
Roll me one up that's as loud as the engine

You too broke to play the part  
Of course I keep some bad women with me in the back  
Sippin' Rose with some hash twistin'  
All about a dollar, my team in the cash gettin'  
Straight out the burg,' where we drink and we smash niggas  
So when I say I'm balling, that don't mean that I'm playing mayne  
All my diamonds talkin', you can see what they sayin' mayne

In the middle of the night, early in the mornin'  
From the streets to the sheets with some freaks, I ain't yawnin'

Come to my house I give 'em everything they want

Having conversations in my face about what I should do for 'em  
What I'mma do keep rolling and dropping weed on 'em  
Pack my bags look like I'm staying for weeks but be gone in the morning  
If the flight is private, we probably should board it  
You see it you like it, I can probably afford it  
If niggas really felt some type of way about the shit I'm doing  
You picked a crazy time to start letting me know  
Cause jealousy and envy that's a trait for mostly bitches  
Not a man so you ain't one if you letting it show

And I ain't holding on to shit I'm letting it go

I get up and does do, I evenly do ten things at once  
Multitaskin' super fast and king of tattin' super pimpin'

Doing features while watching a double feature nigga  
I see you suffering from haterism, get that check

Ain't dealin' with fakes ain't fuckin' with snakes  
They all in my face now they got what it takes my nigga I'm straight  
So don't reach out cause I peaced out when I reached out  
There's no response like knockin' on an empty house

Ugh  
Ugh  
Ugh  
  
See I've been going on and on forever  
Them haters probably wonder when I'm gone stop, never  
Most of it's been good but I've seen some bad weather  
And niggas watching now, wouldn't even give me an umbrella  
But I ain't tripping, I made a million on my own  
May come to your surprise but I pictured it all along  
When I was sixteen, finna get put out my home  
Now the man make the money, my nigga, my money grown  
And I can do what I what, went form being hated on  
To niggas try to go down the same road I made it on  
Ain't no love lost but ain't no love shown  
So now when niggas call I just don't pick up the phone  
I'm breaking down the weed, put it in the bong  
Blow a hundred racks, put it in the song  
Party every weekend, hardly ever home  
Don't get a chance to see me face to face  
So you have to talk about me when I gone  
  
[Chorus]  
Stay away from the fake or phony (phony)  
Niggas who can't support their role  
So keep hatin' me from the crowd  
Everybody wants to be the star of the show-ow-ow  
The show-ow-ow (ow-ow)  
The show-ow-ow (ow-ow)  
The show-ow-ow (ow-ow)  
The show-ow-ow (ow-ow)  
  
The drinks poured up, weed's rolled up  
And all my jewelery ice age the piece froze up  
I only like to see the hoes who keep their nose up  
Have any nigga in the world but she chose us  
I remember them same hoes ain't even notice us  
Get you to buy a drink than its over cous'  
We back around the time that she sober'd up  
But shit ain't been the same since the limousine showed up  
The best moments of my life  
Never filled this much plastic off of Polo in my life  
Rarely gon' to see, smoking with ya wife  
Plus anything you want I can afford to buy it twice  
It's the way we know, wake up in the morn'  
Like ""where did all my paper go""  
Roll some more weed and get medicated  
Everyday is a holiday so we celebrate it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Niggas losing their roles  
Can't play they positions (play they positions)  
One day they down for the team (team)  
Next day they missin' (Next day they missin')  
Same ones was all in the front  
Supposed to be there for support (there for support)  
And half the time it's the ones you care for  
Fuck you here for, huh?  
You wanna be a, big shot, only number one  
Everybody wanna be a superstar  
Big shot, only number one  
But everybody wanna be the star though  
They wanna be a big shot, only number one  
Everybody wanna be a superstar  
Big shot, only number one  
But everybody wanna be the star though  
Ugh  
The money come, the money go  
And when it come down to it  
That's something niggas with real money should know  
We partied a lot, and drank  
Now they don't talk to me  
Started off not so great, now I'm on top of things  
  
I guess the difference is we ain't thinking the same  
So if I'm guilty of change, I guess I'm the one to blame  
I see the bigger picture on the wall in the frame  
Spent a couple of days on team making it rain  
I was cool but, I was thinking ocean views  
Polo trunk shades on and boat shoes  
Cantox lick oil, my nigga I ain't slippin'  
You won't star me out, ugh bad transmission  
So if for the better, yeah a nigga different  
That west coast weed, my homie Wiz twistin'  
Mattress money put up 'cause now my money different  
You got a lot to say, but they ain't never tried to listen  
Record all night in the studio in the morn  
Playin' back when we did, now tell me is that wrong  
Crack the Rose, pop a top or two  
And toast to what this hard work got us to

Old folks jock my car 'cause they know just what this is  
Niggas felxin' hard with no bars, they got weak servants

Look at my ring, if I ain't ballin' bitch then what you call that  
Nothing but net, ain't back 'cause I never left  
I did everything right nigga better yet  
Rolling bomb for the niggas that's around us  
Something like a contractor building from the ground up

Twist up this weed  
Realize that you are in the presence of a G  
Don't fuck up my paper meaning my cheese  
Or the ones I use to roll up my trees  
Fuck it, you know what I mean

I'm in a race, and taking the winners place  
No foot on the brakes  
One the best, homie that's what they call me  
It's lonely at the top, got no company so  
Now I just stunt on my own  
Now I just stunt on my own  
  
See me, when I'm alone, wishing they could fuck with me  
My ex calling my phone, wishing she could stunt with me  
But I'm just riding dog, doing a buck fifty  
Stunting like Jet Li, boat houses and Jet Ski's  
Thirty on the flight, ice like the Gretsky's  
My dime piece only recognize the best tree's  
Treat 'em like I don't need 'em boy, you best believe  
You in her face (You in her face)  
I let her breath

But now they won't leave me alone  
Used to walk the other way  
But now they all come to my home  
And they calling my phone,  
'Cause my paper is long  
Heard nothing, but they singing my songs  
Get hired up, if they want than I bring them along  
We flying up, no you wont need a ticket at all  
Need a ticket at all  
Tell 'em bitch I'ma ball and I'ma buy a new crib for my niggas 'n' all  
'Cause I remember days we'd sit and picture it all  
Nigga swear I'd leave or pictured I'd fall  
Counting reasons why they hate, your bitch think I'm a star  
Cause we are, young, gifted,  
Not to mention out here making motherfucking millions

When you catch the second wind, I'll break you in  
  
Approach the mic slow, it's about to blow  
One foot crow crane, anti-chain movement

Serious men deep in thought, misunderstood, held the fork  
He's too defensive, too mean, you didn't, now it's a scene

Still drunk offa cheap wine  
Holdin' front lines, niggas want to front, fine  
Fuck wit me and mine, rain on your sunshine

Can you dig it? Only five percent live it  
While the rest of you fake niggas try to get it  
Now fuck around

Down wit the all and together down crew  
The jizza, the rizza, me of course too  
The thing I'm analyzing is strickly Hip Hop  
That's what's made, well made is on my workshop  
You was unable plus earn advance  
Just to touch the untouchable kip hop dance  
They're sayin' of the utmost, truly I'm the utmost  
Have you ever caught the hip hop holy ghost  
Man, I mean really, that shit is mad hype  
Especially when you find yourself rhymin' over mics  
I became a wrecker through my amplifier  
Break it down base, treble through my dancer  
That's one new dance, it's to my Black Magic music  
It's not classic, arabic, or basic  
It's strickly thickly, dirty and districkly  
If not don't you pick me and forget me

Yo, too many songs, weak rhymes that's mad long  
Make it brief Son, half short and twice strong  
No doubt, it took time searchin, eventually  
It was prime urgent, for you to examine the rhyme merchant  
  
Lace MC's with styles when they rhyme drunk  
On a label hunt, until twenty thou, out the trunk  
Eight Diagram sword swinga armored tank force  
RZA throw in the disc but then change the bank source

You got lost off the snare off Impeach the President  
Whether in Amsterdam smokin seven grams of green  
Then you pack, a thousand white teens in tight jeans

To analytical analogy, insurance policies why  
Said he know that sounds define the note  
Couldn't recognize, blast him the fuck behind the ropes

Light is shinin' beauty sunshine  
Here comes one-time the ball was so fine  
Heat is blazin' the kids were playin'  
His partner was shady tryin' to slave the babies  
  
Hey yo they didn't know the cop was crooked, he had blow out in  
Brooklyn  
All this while he let the fiends cook it  
The base heads stirred it up, plus they got to blow it up  
Dropped it off in the PJ's and they bigged it up  
Then one day, shit jumped off real crazy  
The middle of a bathroom they find an old lady  
No clothes, half of her tongue, ear missin'  
The killer had to be mad smart, he wore mittens  
Even though her leg was bitten  
Crackheads point the finger at Detective Slick Morris Gittins  
Paleface cop who done popped the desk  
And got the chop on his neck from when he knocked Celeste  
It was a slug, drug, he pressured everybody on the block  
Some niggaz know him as the Godson of Gotti  
And his black partner, he was scared to speak  
He saw how they planted weapons on these kids in the street  
He saw like over fifty bodies in like fifty-two weeks  
He saw his colleague pick up money before leavin' his beat  
They call him desk duty, Robocop  
Younger dudes call him Freddy Krugs from the way he walk on the  
Block  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Heard the disturbance out the window, oh shit they got my son  
Pulled over his Tempo, Brenda dropped the endo  
Had her little nephew with her yo she didn't care  
They always harassed her, until she blew the captain with a razor  
His partner turned red in his waist, Mase done smacked her  
With the walkie, yoked her then slammed her on her face  
He bugged on her like she was drugged, plugged one in her  
The fifth relaxed her like a big thug pistol whipped her  
Heard she was dusted, musta been the way they threw the cuffs on her  
She broke the shits, went and rushed the kid  
Wavin' her hands, she had a half an axe, all in her tracks  
He grabbed her by the air, she broke his jaw it cracked  
More cops arrived, they both bloodied down by the five  
Wildest niggas just smilin' cause it look live  
They gave her forty years in New Orleans, callin me ?  
Shorty was young, by three days had a great bid  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're just worms in the worst part of the apple that's rotten  
You squirm and you turn from the right, still plottin'  
All slimy cause you stay grimy, petty crimey cat  
You sometime me, don't need to remind me about  
Livin' in the core, with the scramblers in front of the store  
The bum holdin' the door, the mugging no one saw  
We played ball in the alley where dope was shot raw  
And the school they kept flawed, plus the lowest test scores  
Small percentage determined to strengthen they position  
Transformation from critical to, stable condition  
But it still be obstacles on niggas that's optical  
Watchin' you like salt-water sharks that's tropical  
The money was the root and it's the instinct to make it  
With they pockets and fridge naked, many aim to take it  
Whether - hold up, set up, stabbin' or a wet up  
Just to know it was the kid next door fizzucked your head up  
Once he fell short, frequently visit the courts  
And for some, another way out, is music and sports  
That's why I, keep the rhyme just as fly as a shot  
That won the championship, with just oh on the clock

Niggas try to flip, tell me who is him  
I blow up his fuckin' prism  
Make it a vicious act of terrorism  
You want to bring it, so fuck it  
Come on and bring the ruckus  
And I provoke niggaz to kick buckets  
I'm wettin' cream, I ain't wettin' fame  
Who sellin' gain, I'm givin' out a deadly game  
It's not the Russian it's the Wu-Tang crushin'  
Roulette, slip up and get fucked like Suzette  
Bring da fuckin' ruckus

But niggas is decay I stick 'em for the cream  
Check it, just how deep can shit get  
Deep as the abyss and brothers is mad fish accept it  
  
In your cross color, clothes you've crossed over  
Then got totally crossed out and Kris Cross  
Who the boss? Niggaz get tossed to the side  
And I'm the dark side of the force  
  
Of course it's the Method Man from the Wu Tang Clan

Let me know it's real son, if it's really real  
Something I could feel son, load it up and kill one  
Want it raw deal son, if it's really real

Today I'll talk about kindness  
Justice, faith and kindness  
I want you to listen carefully  
Kindness and faith, are the foundation  
Without them, we can't become good people  
And with justice, we know we can lead a good life  
And how can I be a good man then, eh?  
Well, first of all, you have to practice honesty  
Uhmm...  
Keep your temper, never lose control of yourself  
Keep control...  
Be patient, if you learn to do these things, you can master anything  
  
[Chorus: The Persuasions ""Gypsy Woman"" sample]  
Out of nowhere, there came a caravan  
This was around a campfire light  
A lovely woman in motion  
Her hair was as dark as the night  
  
[Method Man]  
Cruising on the interstate, just follow while I innovate  
Too many try and imitate, medallion like a dinner plate  
Front and get ya dinner ate, chinchilla for the winter, wait  
I'm trying to bring the ""Sexy Back"" like Timbaland and Timberlake  
Spitting like a calico, kush from a Cali hoe  
Tell that joker ""tally ho"", put shots in that Denali, yo  
RZA you know how we go, on them 20's, that's how we roll  
And I don't eat berries but eat a Berry like Halle though  
The game criminal, my, my chain figaro  
My, my dames pigeon-toed, I'm still the same nigga though  
Uh, kid rock a fitted low, still got a wicked flow  
And I'm like Barry Bonds on anything that RZA throw  
  
[Ghostface Killah]  
On anything that RZA throw, Ironman's invisible  
I left my chick for cheating on me, now that bitch is miserable  
Popping bottles, painting hella Wallo's on my physical  
We gon' have a ball, might as well pick a testicle  
  
Purple haze festivals, smoke a nigga like a bowl  
Fuck a coma, now the state you laying is a vegetable  
You wanna see me? Like you ain't checkable  
You like a CD, I burn you and I wrecked a few...

Only God, has lept into avenged mind  
And can, distinguish good, from evil

We gotta get more cake together, so we could branch out  
Preserve land, get a boat and a ranch house  
Call me a dreamer, but I hustle for real  
You thought that I fell off but now I'm attacking the field  
All in Chicago, grinding, putting it down  
Crush blocks of MC's, I ain't playing around  
Yo, you heard me on The Bassment, giving it to 'em  
Fake dudes hiding they self, but I could see through 'em  
Diggler, what? I'm trying to live and raise kids  
While you throwing up ya sign, I'm laying 'em down, kid  
Plus, I'm back home now, doing my thing  
Thirty dollars to Medina just to cop me a ring  
  
[Chorus 2X]  
  
[Outro: kung fu sample]  
A good friend, holds his drink  
Bad company makes bad wine!  
Drinking among friends  
Red wine means a good life  
A few drinks bring comfort  
Two drinks are enough  
Money can't buy courage  
Riches mean nothing to us  
Brilliant, a display of genius

Rae gotta get a plate now  
Ignorant and mad young, wanted to be the one  
Till I got (Blaow! Blaow! Blaow!) felt one  
Yeah, my pops was a fiend since 16  
Shooting that ""that's that shit!"" in his blood stream  
That's the life of a grimey, real-life crimey  
And niggas know that habit's behind me  
Day one, yo, growing all up in the ghetto  
Now I'm a weed fiend, jetting the Palmetto  
In Medina, yo, no doubt the God got crazy clout  
Pushing the big joint from down South  
So if you're filthy stacked up  
Better watch your back and duck  
Cause these fiends, they got it cracked up  
Now my man from up north, now he got the law  
It's solid as a rock and crazy salt  
No jokes, I'm not playing, get his folks  
Desert Eagle his dick and put em in a yoke  
And to know for sure, I got reck and rip shop  
I pointed a gat at his mother's knot  
Yo, Rae, don't do that shit, man! Don't do that shit!  
Fuck that!

Dedicated to all Jeeps and Land Cruisers

Dedicated to the Y's, 850-I's  
Dedicated to niggas who do drive-bys

Dedicated to the Lexus and the Ac's  
Dedicated to MPV's: phat!  
  
Kicking the fly cliches  
Doing duets with Rae and A, happens to make my day  
Though I'm tired of busting off shots, having to rock knots  
Running up in spots and making shit hot  
I'd rather flip shows instead of those  
Hanging on my living room wall  
My first joint, and it went gold!  
I want to lamp, I want to be in the shade  
Plus the spotlight, getting my dick rode all night  
I want to have me a phat yacht  
And enough land to go and plant my own sess crops  
But for now it's just a big dream  
Cause I find myself in the place where I'm last seen  
My thoughts must be relaxed, be able to maintain  
Cause times is changed and life is strange  
The glorious days is gone, and everybody's doing bad  
Yo, mad lives is up for grabs  
Brothers passing away, I gotta make wakes  
Receiving all types of calls from upstate  
Yo, I can't cope with the pressure  
Settling for lesser  
The God left lessons on my dresser  
So I can bloom and blossom, find a new way to  
Continue to make more hits with Rae and A  
Sunshine plays a major part in the daytime  
Peace to mankind, Ghostface carry a black 9

Started smokin' woolies at sixteen  
And running up in gates, and doing hits for high stakes  
Making my way on fire escapes  
No question I would speed, for cracks and weed  
The combination made my eyes bleed  
No question I would flow off, and try to get the dough all  
Sticking up white boys in ball courts  
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater

Figured out I went the wrong route

A man with a dream with plans to make C.R.E.A.M.  
Which failed I went to jail at the age of 15  
A young buck sellin' drugs and such who never had much  
Trying to get a clutch at what I could not, could not,  
The court played me short, now I face incarceration  
Pacin' going up state's my destination  
Handcuffed in back of a bus, forty of us  
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so ruff  
But as the world turns I learned life is hell  
Living in the world no different from a cell  
Everyday I escape from Jakes givin' chase, sellin' base  
Smokin' bones in the staircase  
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess  
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed  
But I'm still depressed, and I ask what's it worth?  
Ready to give up so I seek the Old Earth  
Who explained working hard may help you maintain  
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain  
We got stickup kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks  
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot  
Leave it up to me while I be living proof  
To kick the truth to the young black youth  
But shorty's running wild smokin sess drinkin' beer  
And ain't trying to hear what I'm kickin in his ear  
Neglected, but now, but yo, it gots to be accepted

He stayed tipsy, said he loved his bills crispy  
Drivin' the streets he kept heat on the night, shifty  
Quickly, who ring bells like it's twelve on Sunday?  
While the stage catch shells from forceful gun play  
Mere fact that the track was a fierce counterattack  
All those who couldn't multiply were sent back  
No tanks, low rank, soldiers hittin' the heart  
Tainted the heart of an empire, was torn apart  
Brought to a halt from a front full assault  
The chemist left the lab with undetermined results  
They saw the swordsman sift electrical volts

Poetry whirlpool, Rza and True collide  
We produce article exception to the rule  
We the black men that struck oil, the hard boiled  
Cats that made that Watergate thing go spoiled  
The heavy-handed, locked down stranged with Cyrus  
Wu Pirates, sneak inside the club, low eyes  
Low down dirty, twelve thirty, night time crawlers  
Off-the-wallers, basketball gun brawlers  
Smoked out throw both fists for nine-seven  
Slang reverend, put the best work in  
  
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang  
""Oh baby, for heavens sake""

If you got it, light it up [8X]  
  
[Method Man]  
Ain't no shook in 'em, Pyrex pots is hot, fiends is cooking 'em  
Little niggaz hugging the block, cops is booking 'em  
Women hugging they purse when they spot the crook in 'em  
Back when little J got shot, pops was whooping 'em  
Little noses dripping with snot, ock, now look at 'em  
The ghetto got a hook in 'em now, drugs, stay pushing 'em  
Used to throwing dirt in these blunts, now, it's kush in 'em  
Used to tell these chicks to shut up, now, he's shooshing 'em  
Get cash, get that ass, or put a foot in 'em  
Iron Flag, flag that cab, Bedford and Put-e-nam  
There ain't no puss in 'em, dick, dildo, or gush in 'em  
Niggaz still got that juks in 'em  
  
[Chorus 2X: Ghostface Killah (Raekwon)]  
If he front then we stomp 'em out (Get 'em out ya way pa)  
If he drunk and he run his mouth (Get 'em out ya way pa)  
If he front then we stomp 'em out (Get 'em out ya way pa)  
(Get 'em out ya way pa, move, move, move)  
  
[U-God]  
I'm seduced by the chrome, it's a ruthless poem  
It took a little time to get his juices going  
Producers know him, as the kid with the Iron Palm  
Righteous hammer, examine the firearm  
Approach or get fired on, permanent chest scar  
Empire Strikes Back, check out the Death Star  
Bless y'all, wet y'all, do the impossible  
Where I'm from, we use dum-dums in the arsenal  
Highly sparkable, get stretched off the knuckle check  
Known to scuffle, I take it to the upper deck  
Universal conquest, kung fu, buckle vets  
  
In a dufflebag, max yo, a couple techs  
Give 'em ear hustle, Wu brand, we programmed  
Next time we dance, it won't be a slow jam  
I fear no man, son, you get lynched up  
Nigga bitch, get Frankenstein stitched up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Masta Killa]  
Yeah, voice skipping off percussion  
Give it to 'em how they love it, slow flow, deadly, beloved  
All praise, the daunting, calm yet  
So alarming, without a word being spoken  
A thought with no voice, just a nod and a look  
The contract was took, straight cash, off the books  
A major pawn took a Don, look, he's armed  
With a few black rooks from the heart of the Crook  
Shook ones look while they hung him on Hercules hooks  
They found his body near a shallow brook, escaped on foot  
Switched the look up, out of state, he got the hook up  
The flipped cake, thought lighter than the feather  
Yet heavier than weight, when my mind state starts to break, take cover  
Over RZA instrumental, I'm damn near invincible, it's simple  
  
[Chorus 2X]  
  
[Outro: kung fu sample]  
Tell me, what are they like?  
They got holes in the top, five round holes  
While I was watching, this stranger, hit them  
But his fingers went right through the bone  
So then, they've... mastered it  
It's some style of kung fu, you know it?  
The Skeleton Claw

And feel the vibe, want to be wise  
We, form on a rising corner mean five  
Laws in disguise, throw on your slides  
Young niggas racist, smokers is basic  
We seen the eyes, laying up playing the cut  
What, stay in the truck, something told me duck  
Folding me up, my shoulders struck  
Out of luck, fuck the potters up  
Fell on a daze like a Golotta snuff  
Niggas tried to body me up  
I'm in the lobby bleeding  
Niggas in the witness office probably eating  
And sprinting and beefing, when they heard the shots  
Called the precinct and seen barber nieces beasting  
Niggas shot Shalar features and shocked her was a Elisis,  
Bent the spinal cordless creatures  
I'm gagging and flagging a cab down  
Guess who in the Benz wagon, dragging my sound down  
Macking it was Dale Breedy the greedy  
Caniving ass snake genie  
Cop with a bikini will murder charge and benini  
I'm feeling wheezy and the drain from the cheeba  
Grieving ain't even looking decent  
Seeing police niggas reaching  
  
That splash against my hollow bones  
That rocks my...

Fleeing the crime scene speeding  
Beefing leaving behind cream  
Not even peeping that I was leaking  
Won't see the precinct just got a recent case beaten  
Still jakes are creeping  
Don't blow ya spot, stay the weekend  
Keep the ruger peeling who's squealing  
Few knew the dealings  
Keep the steel concealed in  
Cause we got no time for feelings  
Eyes on the building guards are on the corners illing  
Million dollar block villain plotting on a killing  
Feel like, a superhero talking like a true Deniro  
They boost his ego path and broke down  
Reduced to zero  
Cops feel we poors hoping I'll reveal my source, source  
  
That splash against my hollow bones  
That rocks my soul  
Oh oh, oh oh

Outside the check cashing, flashing  
Dipped in fashion  
Five cherry-faced fagots tried to cash in  
They keep laughing, Ghost you get ya face bashed in  
Who gave you these privileges son? why you maxing?  
And we..  
Feigning to take those move slow  
I'm hearing how you broke Rob's nose  
And I heard you keep a banging hammer  
Golden brass diamonds embroideries  
That was stolen that you haven't reported g  
Make very little noise, my shit hiccup  
Don't make this big stick up bigger  
Me and the boys I thought for a second then chose  
Rather than froze  
Had the Jim star on my hand  
Yo what the fuck yo! that's when I ripped Timothy  
Snatch and dip john like imbaggable  
Had the mini axe tool, faxed him  
Shots rang off, bing, boggle-de-dumb

Boobies on my gold fronts, iced out notebook

Every line to line, bar for bar is clockwork  
Hazardous and powerful enough to have your block hurt

With torture, from moving with work that's restricted  
We criticize producers til they joints are right  
Then acupuncture the track with pinpoints of light

Get you on the floor, whore tried to double team

Is he really strapped? Will he really split yo' shit?  
I thought you said he rap? Pull up in the yard, ten sets  
He ain't flexing, microphone ripping, heat holding  
Who testing? Rope-a-dope his black lotus  
Can't quote this, chat with the sword tongue  
Duck when the axe is swinging, wild Apache drum  
Crazy Horse kicking his thoughts, he won't quit  
Can't tell 'em nothing, he grown, give the man room  
Space was demanded, beat banging through the speaker  
Voice, heat seek missle, guided at the listener  
Swing to the gospel, catch up and wet at the brothel  
Unstoppable, direction of my flow, optional  
To the ear, depending on the current of air, the crowd's in

Brothers approach and half step but ain't heard  
Half of it yet and I bet you're not a what? Vet?

Couldn't peep it with a pair of bifocals  
I'm no joker, play me as a joke

Crews be acting like they gangs, anyway  
Be like, ""Warriors, come out and play?  
Hurry, I getting it on, I let it out like diarrhea  
Got burnt once but that was only gonorrhea  
Dirty, I keeps the 'nuff stains my drawers  
So I can get Fizzy funky for yuh  
Murder, takes the fame of the Wu-Tang, rahh  
Here comes the Tiger verse Crane  
Ow, be like wild with my style

Bombin' unprepared for departure, might talk but strike harder  
Fear the bow of the silent archer  
Sure shotter, pass the rock to your starter  
Poison darter, news photographers document the horror  
While I bounce Shaunda with Tiwana and I from blue Honda  
Honorable scholar, rockwilder, rip mic's for top dollar  
Your highness, the crowd holla  
Got your head rock, feel the brain trauma  
Crowd sponsor, hotter than Bahama steam saunas  
The Rebel of opera, popped off the chocolate and the gosha  
Monster truck crush you impostors

Desire to kill the righteous dumbs down the brightest  
Give his life in this world that seem so lifeless  
Put a price on things, that are priceless  
The fierceness that meanness is stronger than the niceness  
Who really has the power, is is theirs, is it ours?  
Is it a democracy, or the morning prowlers?

Outdoor, indoor, she's taking the chances  
Hotel, motel or Holiday Inn  
Overlooking that bible, she continued to sin  
Spread wide on the desk, paperwork all in a mess  
While the ceiling fan blowing her dress  
Ten minutes of jerking along with the slurping  
Her skirt hid her talent until I raised the curtains  
Showtime at the Apollo, she'll follow my lead  
Then get on her knees, then swallow her pride  
Strapped and ready to ride

On her word, stay still, rocking linens and furs  
While she do it in the sack, jazz music in the back

Damn right, she the star of my team  
When we stepped on the strip, baby girl, we the heart of the scene

All movements have to be....

My inner light would turn my baby's tear drop to small diamonds  
That be twinklin, while my love be sprinklin  
We stay young while your old wicked faces be wrinklin  
ALLAH's the most gracious, he made the universe the most spacious  
Seen and heard in all places, but still appear faceless  
Embraces all races, all caste and all cases  
In every spec of life he's the substance of all traces  
  
[Break]  
  
The answer to all questions, the spark of all suggestions  
Of righteousness, the pathway to the road of perfection  
Who gives you all and never ask more of you  
The faithful companion that fights every war with you  
Before the mortal view of the prehistorical, historical  
He's the all and all, you searchin for the oracle  
A mission impossible, purely philosophical  
But you call him on your death bed when you layin in the hospital  
  
[Break]  
  
And as you play all day like the grasshopper who work and toil  
Like armies of ants carrying stones of soil  
Building a home for themselves and storing food  
At night we praise ALLAH and adore the moon  
In sync like the flow of the Nile, the growth of a child  
Only fearin' GOD, we great a ghost with a smile  
That which is spirit is spirit, which is flesh is flesh  
Meaning life has no partnership with death

Yo, I've been highly misunderstood by those who met us  
They had ears of corn and heads of lettuce  
Mentally dead, essentially lead by the false teachings  
And eventually pledge their allegiance  
To that which was against them and exempt them from the truth  
Then juiced them and pimp them to givin them ties  
So the church can rise, while their babies home hungry covered with flies  
Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz  
Trying to harness the wind  
ALLAH's the father from without and within  
On Christ return, who will announce him?  
Every tree is numbered, but who can count them?  
The name of all things on this world, who can pronounce them?  
ALLAH is the father of all, why do you doubt him?  
  
[Sample]  
  
The heart is the general, the eyes are the scouts  
the fists are the arrow, the body is the bow  
All movements have to be mental  
The wrist must be strong and the fingers powerful  
Fast, high kicks, a good firm stance  
Avoid the enemy's strong points

We was laughing, at all the girls that passed  
Conversation, brothers had begin to discuss  
(Hey yo, Ra, remember that kid ya bust?)  
Aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far  
Cause I dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh ha!  
Not knowin', exactly what lied ahead  
My little brother, my mother sent him out for bread  
Get the Wonder, it's a hot day in the summer  
Didn't expect, to come across, a crazy gunner  
""Hey Shorty, check it for the bag and the dough""  
But he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said ""No!""  
Money splattered him, BOW! then he snatched the bag  
In his pockets, then he jetted up the Ave.  
Girls screamin', the noise up and down the block  
(Hey, Rakeem!) What? (Your little brother got shot!)  
I ran frantically, then I dropped down to his feet  
I saw the blood, all over, the hot concrete  
I picked him up, then I held him by his head  
His eyes shut, that's when I knew he was  
Aw man! How do I say goodbye?  
It's always the good ones who have to die  
Memories in the corner of my mind  
Flashbacks, I was laughin' all the time  
I taught him, all about the bees and birds  
But I wish I had a chance to sing these three words

Bout to hit the skins, from this girl named Thelma

Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect  
We was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed  
Three o'clock in the morning, something gots to give  
Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next  
Here, take this raincoat, and practice safe sex  
He seemed to ignore, I said be for real  
She's not even worth it, to go raw deal  
A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do  
He got butt-naked and stuck the power you  
Twenty minutes went by, my man went out, without a doubt  
I'm not pumpin' up, I am, airin' you  
Hey yo, he came out laughing with glory  
I'm surprised, he's still livin', to tell his story  
But he carried on, with the same old stuff  
with Stephanie, like a whammy, he pressed his luck  
Both tried to be down with O.P.P.  
Ain't nothin' wrong but he got caught with the H.I.V. now  
No life to live, doc says two more years  
So after the laughter, I guess comes the tears

First thought was to snatch the ratchet, said fuck it and fucking grabbed it  
I ducked, he bucked twice, this nigga was fucking laughing  
I wrestled him to the ground, tustle, scuffle, constantly kicked him  
He wouldn't let go the joint so I fucking bit him  
Shots was whizzing, hitting Clorox bottles  
Customers screaming, then the faggot ran out of hollows  
I had to show him what it's all about  
Next thing you read in the paper ""A man who came to kill, gets knocked out""  
  
[Chorus: Erykah Badu]  
I don't know whhhhhhhhhhhy... nobody told you  
Man's not supposed to cry...  
Though we're just babies... and you're so crazy  
How tears of joy, bring so much life  
  
[Method Man]  
Yo aiyo yo yo yo  
You on ya way to the store, nigga, grab me a Dutch  
I'm mad as fuck, my dude, my count was short when I was bagging it up  
Now I need liquor, nigga pass me a cup  
What's up with Officer Brown? The other day he tried to shackle me up  
He killed Kase and now he hassling us  
This motherfucker got balls, even the gaul to try and patten me up  
Time to re-up, let these niggaz know we back on the block  
With three hundred off a G-pack, it's cracking the spot

Still go to why y'all restaurant for steamed fish and Irish moss

Your whole show wack and I'ma cancel your sitcom

I zoom in, while the listeners tune in  
Some assuming they paid dues and joined the union  
Lost nigga couldn't rumble in this wild jungle  
Quick to crumble, type to be on the stand and fumble  
Divine Master, threw on the track that made 'em bleed  
He produce at unattainable rains of top speed  
This powerful magnet, that left 'em stagnant  
Was unlikely in cameras in larger fragments  
Un-filled rifle, scout sniper, shots precise  
Starlight scope, with the night vision device  
Splendid marksman, that'll shoot the one off the dice  
Split a grain of rice, in one shot we kill 'em twice

Yeah, I was looking out my window  
  
when i heard this sound  
  
look up into the sky  
  
saw the moon turned to blood  
  
looked at my little brother  
  
said, ""you high as hell maaan""  
  
  
Chorus:  
  
  
Apocalypse..  
  
1,2 the headlines youths just rolled through  
  
Apocalypse..  
  
3,4 solder, 100 horsemen at your door  
  
Apocalypse..  
  
5,6 you wanted dead or alive, hit or miss  
  
We we y'all, yeah, we we y'all  
  
  
Verse One:  
  
  
Arrival of the Carnival  
  
New beats, I never recycle  
  
While your looking for samples  
  
You might get trampled  
  
Surprise, hey  
  
I'm back with lightning and thunder  
  
I heard you over saying that i was a one year wonder  
  
You dumb or some, i went to refugees  
  
Silly felony, when i'm done  
  
Collect royalty from record company's  
  
Clouds getting darker  
  
Suns getting nearer  
  
I'll turn a atheist into a god fearing believer  
  
The back of a building  
  
Your body's found by children  
  
Playin' hide go seek  
  
All we found was his skeleton  
  
In the back of a car  
  
You spawned with the wrong guard  
  
You know my empire strikes back hard  
  
Listen hard, war  
  
This is the day after action  
  
Projects, cannons  
  
Being launched at the palace  
  
Vision, revelation  
  
Sky know apocalypse  
  
Enemy pilots kamikaze into the abyss  
  
  
Chorus:

Verse Two:  
  
  
Aiyyo, Back on earth  
  
The party is in the tunnel  
  
On the west side of the river  
  
Went mad quiver  
  
Rats get fed to the alligator  
  
Gun blast equivalent to the bombs in pearl harbor  
  
Rescue choppers broke the turn to hiroshima  
  
I'm driving to jersey to escape the terror  
  
I was on the highway pushing a black viper  
  
A car pulls up, is he a jack or a sniper (sniper)  
  
A blue range rover, he says pull over  
  
I didn't know he was a DT undercover  
  
I screamed out my lungs  
  
This is discrimination!  
  
He tried, he said you just robbed a gas station  
  
Who me? not me! it couldn't be  
  
I was in the Grammys with Brandy  
  
Didn't you see me on tv?  
  
Bullshit, y'all all in the same game  
  
He tried to run me off the road  
  
Like he was rosco, rico or dre  
  
I stayed calm, gave him a hell of a show  
  
Cause when its time to go  
  
All i gotta press is turbo  
  
Heard it on his walkie, road block on 280 west  
  
Things got serious, that's when i bust a left  
  
you-Turn, my eyes burned  
  
My concern was a truck coming  
  
Head on collision within a chase position  
  
Close one, i almost went up in a blaze  
  
Running from what appears to be a masquerade  
  
Least that what i thought, it was all in my mind  
  
Reality stuck when i got to the borderline  
  
The headline reads every ghettos sad story  
  
A rookie shoots a boy over mistaken identity...

I'm vexed, my phone rings, collect call from Jeff  
The operator say, ""If you accept, say yes""  
""Yes, what's the deal, son?""  
""Yo, I got bad news""

Shalom, shalom, pardon my left  
But my right hand's on your throat, massaging you to death  
You provoke the cycle, call Michael  
You're lookin' in the mirror, well, I'm in your window, oh oh  
You hear me Urkel, your blood will turn purple  
Like the colour, you holler, ballin' for your mother  
No-one hears you even though you knock  
You used to walk around the block with the daily rock  
Things done changed since your spark got hot  
Now you got your knot wocked with your very own glock

Clef and the rest of the game with me  
And me and Miss LaBelle, we rep the same city (get up)  
Philly, home of the blunts and the cheese steaks  
And I cannot be stopped, like I need breaks (get up)  
  
Let's celebrate, have a basement party  
A barbeque how we used to do (yeah)  
On the avenue, have a family reunion  
Man, how I miss those days  
When the kids was kids, no knives on the street  
When the ice cream man came around the way  
Lord, Miss Patti, won't you help me sing  
Lord knows how I miss those days  
  
Dressing up for church on Easter Sunday (how I miss those days)  
Doing the electric slide at every party (how I miss those days)  
Oh, if only you knew, what I've been through (you would celebrate)  
You would celebrate (everybody just celebrate, how I miss those days)  
Get up, you would celebrate (celebrate, everything's gonna be ok, how I miss
those days), get up  
  
Celebrate (you would celebrate), everything's gonna be ok, how I miss those
days (get up)  
You would celebrate, everybody just celebrate, how I miss those days

Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
I'm sure y'all heard about my dad  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
This one goes out for everybody that lost somebody  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
Be strong  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
  
Now I understand what Scarface meant  
When he said I never seen a man cry till I seen a man die  
Never in my deepest thoughts that I would imagine  
I would be the one carrying a coffin  
Yo I feel like a orphan even though I got a mom  
I'm the first born so I gotta play strong  
Memories of the past bout when we cried when we laughed  
It makes it hard, dad, for me to finish write this paragraph  
I remember when we all shoved snow frost bites and all  
Temperature forty below  
You used to call me lazy cause I said it was too cold  
But you would go in the crib fix me a fresh cup a cocoa  
I can't front  
I wish there was a sequel of the sixth sense  
So I could see dead people  
I'm so hurt, dad  
I can't cry no more  
But I know that you're knockin on heaven's door  
Peace  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
Rest in peace, dad  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
All my people live on  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
Rest in peace, dad  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
  
Look into my eyes  
Realize I'm the same man my father was  
y'all can tell by my Pink Cadillac  
The way I clean my ride  
Old grim tilted to the side  
But what I loved most was when the God philosophize  
About the philosophies of life in its reality  
Keep the right mentality  
Don't fall into vanity  
Sometime I feel like he standin watchin over me  
Whisperin in my ear, baby boy, I'm still here  
I heard him said I'm the shadow right beside you  
And if you confused, son, I'm there to guide you  
And even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death  
I fear no evil  
For the Lord is wit me  
But don't forget that your mom's in your hands  
You two were so close  
That I finally understand  
And here's a message to your brothers and your sisters  
I'ma miss em  
No matter what I'mma be wit em  
Peace  
  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
To my dad, rest in peace  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
I guess I'll see you at the resurrection  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
To all my people that lost somebody  
Da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
Put the lighters in the air  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
Oh, daddy  
Oh, daddy  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
Oh, yeah, yeah  
I need you, daddy  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
Oh, oh  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy

Wyclef Jean,Fresh Interlude,/w/wyclef+jean/fresh+interlude_20147489.html,"Yo yo, this Wyclef, alongside DJ Skribble (for the ladies)  
Yo Skribble I have one question  
Could you please answer this for me?  
I gotta know this yo  
  
What makes a DJ  
What makes an MC  
What makes the ReFugees  
Why are kids getting jealous?  
  
'Cause we F, are, E, S, H  
Fresh, fresh, fresh, that's, fresh!  
F, are, E, S, H  
Fresh, fresh, fresh, that's, fresh!  
  
Hey you, player, with the dibble and the dabble  
You want to battle who? Wyclef or DJ Skribble  
Hold the stickup it's a freestyle session  
Skribble where you from man  
Well I'm from Haiti, then Brooklyn, then Jersey  
With a universal tag, plus I got  
You slept on this musician, plus the hip-hop art  
Bring your best MC's  
'Cause every man got disciples if you ever want a rival  
Show up, with a mic, and a rifle  
Wyclef stuck the bank at mid-day  
And took all of Sony money, in a black van he got away  
I just got a call from Tommy Mottola  
He said forget about it ""oh my word""  
So I held John Agrassia, at gunpoint  
He's shook, callin' Donny Aiena, while smokin' a joint  
I said, 'Who's the informer?' They say, 'Michael Malden'  
I had to take him out ""Three the hard way!""  
The moral of this story don't blame the record company  
If your record ain't selling you lack creativity  
  
But what you want me to say? What what you want me to say huh?  
Yo I've been trying to get a deal for, years and it ain't  
What you want me to say?  
  
""And I'll kill anyone, who dares to go against me!""

Maybe the church, coulda been the street  
Perhaps it was the guitar, or Jerry Wonder beats  
Maybe the money when I didn't have a dime  
Maybe a way out before committing crimes  
Coulda been Lauryn, perhaps it was Pras  
Probably the mirror looking dead in my eyes  
Coulda been reggae, or the love of hip-hop  
Maybe my fans at the show saying don't stop  
Probably the struggle of all refugees  
Maybe the sign how the diamonds bling-bling, ching-ching  
Ring ring, there's a call from my wifey, whoo  
Perhaps I gotta make it home but music keep calling me

However you want it, you don't want it, cuz when you get it it hurts  
Your body carried out the church  
Mom, she be cryin holdin on to her purse sayin... (oh...)  
  
Aiyyo  
What y'all thought I was too busy writin songs with Whitney Houston  
Cuz ""My Love's Your Love"" will be my slugs wit blood  
For any thug that wanna bang and play orangutang  
Find yourself in the river with the rest of them  
Wake up, wake up, I'm in a nightmare dream  
Where I found myself loadin magazines after magazines  
Ski mask on my face, gun on my waist  
Fine pens shakin in my hand as I write this next line  
You look strange, shootin victims at close range  
And saw his vein burst from his neck, as I snatched his chain  
Is this a Bible, I used to read the Gospel  
Until I got betrayed by one of my twelve disciples  
Which one, look through the crowd son  
You could spot the traitor wit a tatto on his arm  
The symbol is a microphone, an intellectual  
A wannabe Rakim, but too extraterrestrial  
I heard he's lethal and I'm too rusty to battle him  
Me being rusty is like Biggie not being ""Born Again""  
It never happen, watch who you call fam  
On MTV, he painted himself as the tin man  
Predicted platinum, way before it happened  
So that's why when you ship gold, you only sold aluminum  
  
And now you wanna tell everybody I messed up your record?  
C'mon!  
  
However you want it, you don't want it, cuz when you get it it hurts  
Your body carried out the church

Your body carried out the church  
Mom, she be cryin holdin on to her purse sayin... (oh...)  
  
You a thug? You aint a murderer, just an undercover caligula  
Cuz when you saw the luger became silent like Caesar  
Enough of this rap stuff, Sedeck take his watch  
If I wasn't rappin, I'd take that stash in your left socks  
Don't make me raise my voice cuz I'm masterin a coo  
So, and besides when they find you you'll be bones  
Mom say watch my peers, hangin like chandeliers  
Orderin Don P, you couldn't pay for one beer  
Perpetratin, a fraud, oh god, you aint hard  
Take thirty of y'all to murder one kid on the boulevard  
You want Wyclef Jean, bring your same thug guys  
Here's my advice, leave the ring with your bride  
Cuz you aint comin back no more  
We gon send you to a vacation for two, with crabs on the seashore  
You freeze up, hold up I really thought you was psychotic  
Is that tears in your eyes? You cryin for your life  
Kid you tellin me what you did, you didn't wanna do  
Watch what you say on record cuz it might come true  
  
However you want it, you don't want it, cuz when you get it it hurts  
Your body carried out the church

Should I take them? Should I wait?  
Should I take them? Should I wait?  
Should I take them? Should I wait?  
I say ""No Woman, No Cry"" like I should own a piece of the estate  
But at the tribute they didn't invite me  
So I put in a call to Halis Alassi  
He said be easy, aint no need to bust a shot (BLOW! BLOW! BLOW! BLOW!)  
Like Supercat said, yo the ghetto's red hot  
Before bling, bling, bling it was BLING, BLING, BLING!

Cause her man got so many uzi's you'd think he was Cadivi  
Meanwhile, she's getting her nails done  
Crystal clear so they could shine like wit diamonds  
  
It's such a shame what happened last week  
Man they found her under the sheets with a letter from the Son of Sam  
It said to tell New York I ain't sleepin  
You want to be clubbin then you better pack your heat in  
  
And to my man G Swar Rest in Piece

To my people who don't want to go to work

Wyclef Jean,Next Generation,/w/wyclef+jean/next+generation_10188787.html,"Hold on now, don't die now, be strong now  
He said, I was born a crack baby  
In a plastic bag in the alley  
Raised in a foster home  
With no mother to love and I never knew my papi  
Back in the days of Bobby McFerrin  
Used to sing don't worry, be happy  
Lord how can I be happy  
When I don't even know my own family tree Lord  
  
We are the next generation, we ain't scared to die  
The only thing I fear is the after life  
'Cause I don't know what's there on the other side  
But I pray the Lord forgives me, gives me one more try  
  
Gang poppin' things, doing drive-by's and angers  
Kids going to school putting fears in their teacher  
The teacher let them know that it ain't all good  
'Cause the gang was created to protect the neighborhood, now  
All you red now, all you blue now  
All you yellow now, follow me now  
To that place of righteousness  
Where the only thing that matters is your consciousness, he said  
  
We are the next generation, we ain't scared to die  
The only thing I fear is the after life  
'Cause I don't know what's there on the other side  
But I pray the Lord forgives me, gives me one more try  
  
In my father's kingdom there are many mansions  
All the rooms are free, there is no tax collection  
I can see Biggie, Tupac, Moses and Abraham  
Jason, the one and two's, jamming with the sun of man  
  
I've been kicked, I've been stabbed  
I've been shot, I've been ? by a  
Person that I thought I trusted, where I live  
It's a war at the cribs, walk with a strap  
Myself 'cause I don't want nobody's son on my back  
My mind playing tricks ?, to really ?  
Me out in five unless I take another hit  
I done seen the sun set on the other side of town  
Now I'm drifting in the darkness, Heaven hold me down  
? but I know I'm born dying  
Feel the tears of the angels looking down on me crying  
For a lying ass but yo forgive us in a while  
And I'm sorry, never let me forget that I'm your child  
While I'm locked up in this basement staring eye to eye with Satan  
In this cold dark world with no patience  
We get plotted on by agents with talks of replacing  
The Africans, Jamaicans and the Haitians in this next generation  
  
We are the next generation, we ain't scared to die  
The only thing I fear is the after life  
'Cause I don't know what's there on the other side  
But I pray the Lord forgives me, gives me one more try  
  
Whoa, we the next generation, look at what we facing  
The kids raise themselves, all kind of temptation  
Flowers and candles decorating all the pavements  
No, the perpetrator ain't seeing no arrangements  
Nobody cares about the feelings of the poor  
Man they suffer while we spending eighty billion on a war, uh  
Cutting school budgets, US stockmarket plummets  
Condition's only worse and I wonder what become it  
Metal detectors replace music classes  
Angry little kids want to beat their teacher's asses  
The red and blue's, somebody gotta lose  
Reality TV be reality for who  
I don't question what the Lord found in me  
I just pass it on to folks with no boundaries  
Got a long road ahead of us, AIDS already gettin' us  
Now we got stars, how many will there be left of us  
  
We are the next generation, we ain't scared to die  
The only thing I fear is the after life  
'Cause I don't know what's there on the other side  
But I pray the Lord forgives me, gives me one more try

going to happen, ya know mean?  
All I said was ""Aiight, I got this chiki bang bang dang da dang""  
Then it all got it started for me, man  
Yo, man I'm just getting back from the tour, man  
What it be like, man?  
Yo, bust it, turn me up  
Somebody told me if you can make in New York City, man, you can  
make it anywhere else, man  
Somehow I believe that shhhh  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, what a night  
Late December, 1993 (what happened?)  
Who thought he would rule the industry?  
What an MC on the grind  
  
Yo, I ain't always have whips, I ain't always have yachts  
I ain't always have chips, I ain't always have rocks  
Matta fact I was a grimey little negro  
Who said if music didn't work, I'd sell diesel  
What cha'll thought, I wasn't raised in the projects?  
First of the month waitin for that PA check  
Lived on the first floor  
Were so poor that if you rung the buzzer the roaches would answer the door
(who is it?)  
I went from boy to man in one night  
When I saw my life flash like light from poltergeist  
What made it worse, I couldn't speak English  
But from his facial expressions, he wanted my Adidas  
So hurry up and come out and play  
I'll be damned if I leave bare-footed in this hallway  
And I got big plans, so beg your pardon  
Cause next year this time I'ma sell out the Garden  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yo, yo, I ain't gonna brag and boast and say I did it all  
But I'm the only rapper to play Carnegie Hall  
The first rap group, video cost a million  
First rapper to ever rep for the Haitians  
And sa fa say, na boolay  
Grammy night, we took 3 away  
22 million sold, I can't believe this  
There's still ain't a rapper alive who could achieve this  
But I ain't satisfied, when back to my home contemplating  
How could I become the next Quincy Jones?  
That's when Jerry hit me up on the horn and said  
""Clef, your on the cover of  
the cover of The Source by The Rolling Stones""  
No more struggling, good life we loving it  
You could live it too, if you only publish it  
So here we go, so what's the scenario?  
I own so many cars that I'm renting 'em for videos

With they mouth taped up  
Lookin' like sittin' ducks  
Well you don't look like a sittin' duck and your mouth ain't taped up  
What more small the market, Clef  
You get stuck up  
With what  
From a fiend  
I just bought a twenty-two

Cause the gun looks bigger than you  
Now get your ass back in the house  
Shut up!

Peace God  
Peace  
You gave me the voice to speak, God  
Masquerade, my message to the streets, y'all  
  
Yo peace God  
These words came from a revelation  
Whether you free or you going through incarceration  
Inhale, exhale herbal meditation  
Put the fire arms away  
Cause we don't want no confrontation  
Not me, I'm talkin bout you jerk  
Cause when you die your life ain't even worth the paperwork  
So, peace God, even through war we bring peace  
And after the blood shed then your first son deceased  
And you will understand I'm the beginning of the end  
The alpha, omega, the present, and the future  
So hold on to your Winchester  
Cause the hollow tip penetrate lead through your polyester  
Peace God, even though we ice the wrist  
Guzzle the fifth  
Protect us with a crucifix, Lord  
And bless me with an extra clip  
So just in case one jam release my twin from my waistband  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Aye, yo peace God  
I ain't tryin' to see the graveyard  
But in this game of life I was dealt the wrong card  
I wasn't born this way it just came to be  
Sellin' crack through a alley where the fiends rally  
Where the dealer was the president  
And the fiend was the voter so they voted for the government  
And stick ups was only natural  
It seem every other day a new gun pointed at you  
Peace God  
Yo only God got the answer  
And sorry bout ya mom dyin' of cancer  
But congratulations, I heard you no longer a runner  
You a big man now, the black Tony Montana  
But watch out cause I heard wealth bring envy  
Trust me I did sing for the Kennedies  
Until we meet again feel my words through my pen  
And stay pure in the city of sin

It goes love, hate, pleasure and pain  
Four albums in the can and I'm still in the game (what up?)  
And last album, they don't like me to tell this  
Debuted at number one and sold more records than Elvis (shut up!)  
That's what they telling me, switch up your melody  
Through with misdemeanors, they trying to give rappers felonies  
So they can lock us up one at a time  
But true writers stay free in every one of our lines  
And if you not feeling I'm the cream of the crop  
I'll knock rappers off your list 'til I get to the top!  
Still you looking at a man that's financially stable  
Only nigga getting checks cut from four different labels  
That Pillsbury dough, women poke my guts  
Still I walk around the streets like I'm broke as fuck  
So if you see me in your town and I appear to be moody  
It's cause I'm thinking 'bout plans that's bigger than Serena booty  
Me and shaka still starving and looking for meals  
And heads up! Ludacris is almost out of his deal  
I'm over ten million sold, every album is crack  
And for now I'm bout to carry def jam on my back  
Mad rappers I hear you talking way down at the bottom  
Though I make big money, still handle small problems  
The rambling at the mouth, I don't play that shit

Used to roll dice when the love was on my side, man  
Four, five, six walked away with the Grammy  
Seen many blocks turn to the Twilight Zone  
D.A. on a case like Sherlock Holmes  
My old high school sweetheart started sniffin' a bone  
For the right bag she deep blow deeper than the baritone

Investments for the natural world  
Their divestments  
Truth is knowledge  
Although bipolar if it's attainment is equitable  
Man's mirrors face the flesh  
But hide the spirit  
In opposite worlds  
Vision can only be attained universally  
Lamps of varied sizes and shapes carrying different shades  
All having the propensity to illuminate  
Let's ruminate on realization  
That the means is the end  
The earth's water is mirroring the stream of consciousness  
The dead being reborn  
As flowers smiling through the battlefields

It's the rock and roll boys, turn your radio down

DMX, Limp Bizkit, Sheryl Crow amongst many  
Yo, just before I got on stage this chick came on to me  
She offered me sumthin  
It looked kinda strange, it was in a bag  
I said ""Yo, girl let me talk to you real quick""  
Yo  
  
I don't sniff cocaine 'cause it mess up my brain  
For sexual stimulation I never did no ecstasy  
I don't pop pills, I never did no LSD  
but I wouldn't mind a kiss from Ms. Mary  
'Cause  
  
She's homegrown and you can hold her in her backyard  
She's homegrown and you can get a kiss in her backyard  
  
I remember when I was a young boy  
I waited for my grandad, ""So daddy can I get a puff?""  
He looked at me, he says ""Son, man, you're too young kid""  
""When you get older now and you understand that""  
""I let you get one kiss from Ms. Mary""  
'Cause  
  
She's homegrown and you can grow her in her backyard  
She's homegrown and you can hold her in her backyard  
If she allows you to you can roll her up  
She's homegrown and you can kiss her in her backyard  
She's homegrown - I like to be with you Ms. Mary - in your backyard

Some live for the bill  
Some kill for the bill  
She wined for the bill  
Grind for the bill  
(And she used to be the sweetest girl)  
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay they bill  
(And she used to be the sweetest girl)  
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy on the bill  
  
High school she was that girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym  
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)  
High school she was  
That girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym  
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)  
Never thought she would come and work for the president  
Mr. George Washington (where my money at?)  
She thought he'd call (where my money at?)  
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day  
All she wanna know is (where my money at?)  
Closed legs don't get fed, go out there and make my bread  
All you wanna know is (where my money at?)  
She ended up in a road car, bruised up, scarred hard  
All you wanna know is (where my money at?)  
She thought he'd call (where my money at?)  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause I'm a tell you like you told me  
Cash rules everything around me  
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)  
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)

Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)  
  
Pimpin' got harder cos, hoes got smarter  
On the strip is something they don't wanna be a part of  
Rather be up in the club shakin' for a thug  
For triple times the money and spending it how they wanna  
They got they mind on they money, money on they mind  
They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the nines  
See everyday they feel the struggle, but staying on they grind  
And ain't nobody takin' from us, and that's the bottom line  
But I know there's a draught in the block  
You move slow  
You getting' pressure from cops  
you don't know not to lay low  
Because 25 to life is no joke  
To all my real gorillas thuggin'  
On top of corners every day strugglin'  
All the beautiful women getting' money  
Washin' them dollar bills like laundry  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Money, money-money-money  
Money, money-money-money  
It drives the world crazy  
  
She used to be  
  
She used to be the sweetest girl  
She used to be the sweetest girl ever  
Now she like sour Amaretto  
She wears a dress to the T like the letter  
And if you make it rain she will be under the weather  
She used to run track back in high school  
Now she tricks on the track right by school  
She takes a loss cause she don't wanna see her child lose  
So respect her, I'll pay up for the time used  
And then she runs to the pastor  
And he tells her there will be a new chapter  
But she feels no different after  
And then she asks him  
Where my money at?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Some live for the bill  
Some kill for the bill  
(Yeah, where my money at?)  
She wined for the bill  
Grind for the bill  
(Whoa, where my money at?)  
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay the bill  
(Yeah, where my money at?)  
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy on the bill  
(Whoa) Where my money at?

I'm countin' money in the jungle  
Hey yo! The Streets Are Like A jungle  
Guns go off in the jungle  
  
I tip my derby like Zorro  
Ain't no such things as war heroes  
Frontline planes fly by, like the sparrow (BLAOW!)  
My face hits the dirt, flashbacks of Vietnam  
Remind me of the L.A. riots, when it was on  
Fire hits the street, neon lights are bright  
My tank cuts the corner, enemies take flight (That's right!)  
Make no mistake, you can't have this cake it took too long to bake  
and you can't carry this weight, so move on  
These are the words of the elders  
Babysitters got caught with cocaine in a baby's diapers  
Explain that, in the form of a rap  
She got caught with vals, A-CRACK-A-LACK-A-LACK!!!  
Now I'm upset, I get back to the projects  
First one I blast was a usual suspect, a fiend  
In the alley, named Ricky  
Talked to a Det. rookie, gave him the info  
About the paliquo, and where he gotta go  
All he want in return is a Sony stereo  
  
Hey yo! The Streets Are Like A Jungle  
I'm countin' money in the jungle  
Hey yo! The Streets Are Like A jungle  
Guns go off in the jungle  
  
Hey yo my mind is my business so I'm...  
Minding my own, in the club 'til this girl said,  
""Let me see your telephone""  
I passed her my celly  
She called her girl Mary  
And said that she just broke up with her nigga out in D.C.  
She needs a new honey, in the city she gets lonely  
I finally figured out her man's locked up in a penatentary  
So tell me, what should I do when she gets off the phone?  
The devil said, ""Clef, take her ass home!""  
God says, ""Repect her, her man's in the pen""  
This kid pushed me from behind, ""Yo, why you fuckin' with my woman?!!!""  
Then his girl looked at me, she winked! I blinked!  
Now he's coming up to me with the gorilla instinct  
Aww, cool-n-shit! I'm sittin' here eatin' shrimp  
Besides, I would hate for you to be a missing link  
He said, ""Son, do you know who I am?! I'm no man, but one man  
who? The son of Sam!""  
I said you've got this wrong, I never sung your girl a love song  
He drew for his weapon, there's no more conversation  
Cock!Cock!Cock!Cock!Cock!Cock! He released!  
then breathe, His aim went off balance  
The music got tense  
That's when I knew I was in trouble! The street is like a jungle!  
I jumped behind the bar, but caught two in the ankle! POW! (Echo)

No ambulance, no police sirens to interrupt my silence, aha ? dinero  
Means I work hard and have a warm day

So here's a ticket, meet me on the beach in the shade  
  
When I was young they called me Robin Hood  
'Cause I stole from the rich and I gave to the poor  
Went back home, mama whooped on my ass  
Said I'll be damned if I let you live like that  
Meanwhile next door neighbors jumpin'  
Beatin' on his wife while the kids were watchin'

Wakin' up at five with the cold in my eyes

Prayin' if I ever make it, I'm gon' help my family make it  
From the streets of Brooklyn, to the Jersey ? ?

Wait a minute girl! You're my joy, happiness that you bring  
Turn the fall back to spring girl, you're my bling

There's no stars, shinin in the ni-iight

Be a man, no matter what the circumstances  
Ahhhow!

You can see from the freeway above  
No silhouette, but a light left on  
Burning there for love  
smoke is rising from the fire  
Coming out my back door  
I'm inside, sound asleep  
Cigarette on the floor  
Burning there for love  
well I can still remember  
A couple of years ago  
When the smoke and flame called my name  
It was a burning house of love  
that rusty nail over our front door  
Is where I hung our tears in the rain  
I threw that horseshoe into the weeds  
To see what luck can bring  
cause you're in your bed, I'm in mine  
On either side of town  
I think I might take a ride  
And burn your love house down  
Like a burning house of love

Will give me strength  
Will give us hope  
  
And I'll never lose your touch

This will take me a while

But for now I miss your smile  
It's gonna take me a while  
  
Thank you for your loyal stance

Thank you for the happiness  
That you gave to our lives  
Although now our hearts are cracked  
And our tears are slow to dry  
We must count ourselves  
The lucky ones  
For we were with you in your prime

And all this road I see for real  
In four twenty time  
There will be fourteen days  
When sadness climbs  
And there will be times when I feel chilled  
With you on my mind  
This is the thing I do

Listen to the spirits, came up strong  
All put together with same layer song  
This is how they did it, spears by their side  
Stood on the mountain for their land rights  
All the people noticed, movement took fly  
They said  
This is our home, just honor our lives  
Ooh, this is our home, just honor our lives  
Country it was speaking, land of God  
Families were broken, spirits were crushed  
The language that was silenced, set free to be passed  
The cup that was empty, slowly filled up  
So we can prove together, show our children it is time  
You see this is our home, just honor our lives

May just crack and break

She was a girl  
From a far away land  
Far more beautiful  
Than the picture in his hand  
She had eyes  
That would draw him in  
They took a plane ride  
Together they would find  
Her long lost smile  
They went home again  
Back to her friends  
Back to repair her heart  
He loved this girl  
With all of his heart  
He wanted her mind  
Her secrets and her trust  
She would never do him any harm  
He'd give her the world  
If it sat in his palm  
One rainy day  
It was dark in the sky  
She turned and she said to him  
With grey in her eyes  
Go home again  
Go back to your friends  
Go back and repair your heart  
Go home again  
Go back to your friends  
Go back and repair your heart  
His heart turned to liquid  
And it trickled from his eyes  
All he could do now  
At this point in his life  
Was to go home again  
Back to his friends

That I feel inside for you.  
I want to tell you tonight,

And I know what love can do,  
When the arrow points at you,  
But I'm so afraid to trust.

I see Slim and he said he didn't recognize me  
Was it that or did he let another man to find me?

Blood relatives I could turn to when I'm feeling trouble  
And talk about my struggles  
My uncle John Nail, he only put me on the phone  
With different females  
And this is such a such, nephew, tell me, what's up?  
Ain't even ask about your man in Cali, growing up  
Fuck, I drink it all and I smash the bottle  
Self medicated numb, but I'm a feel it tomorrow

But now that pain was gone I got my second win  
Only the strong live long, you better settle in

Xzibit,Cold World,/x/xzibit/cold+world_20168654.html,"Justine, 19, just got clean  
Fresh outta rehab with self-esteem  
She ain't felt this good in a while  
A new leash on life, a vibrant thang, a beautiful smile  
Used to run with a circle of friends, who was skeleton thin  
Sniff white lines off powerful men  
But see, all that's a thang of the past, she got class  
And be damned if she'd let herself burn and crash  
She ain't from money so she startin from scratch  
It's hard working for scraps  
It take everything she got not to relaspe  
Locked down in 9 to 5, but at the 9 to 5  
She get sexually harassed and chastised  
Boss is a married man, she won't touch him  
Frustrated angry man, she won't fuck him  
She's out of her job, at Basket Cakes  
Least it came wit an 8, 2 lines to the face  
God Damn!  
  
[Chorus]  
It's a cold, cold, world, and you know it  
Niggaz will lay you down and take your bread, yeah and you know it  
Only two choices, you can give it up or you can just die with it!  
Only two choices, you can give it up or you can just die with it, yeah  
  
He was on his own, at a very young age  
When he learned from the streets, made everything change  
See he came up with hustlers, lost his religion  
It's funny how money can make a nigga think he livin  
I ain't talkin paper like Jigga or Dre  
It's more like 7500, 9 ounces of lle'  
That's what he say he can get for the flip, they thought the deal was legit  
But he stuck him and split, in deep shit  
Now his mother work for minimum pay  
Live a positive way, she the first one at church every Sunday  
Blind to the needs of her son, he's a gatling gun  
In the streets, jackin niggaz for fun  
It's a non-stop search through the hood, but can't catch him  
They found out where mom stayed and went steppin  
The evil that men do, but still we continue  
With death and dishonor, for the all mighty dollar, it's so cold  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He was 13, brought up in Baghdad  
Ate with his right and made money with his left hand  
Prayed to the East, 5 times daily  
His mother and father just had a new born baby  
Now his father was an Imam who carried the weight  
And built his family on 5 pillars of faith  
Never trippin off Western ways, it meant nada  
Pilgramige to Mecca to circle around Kabba  
300 miles away, British troops hit Basra  
His cousin waged jihad and died with honor  
He heard about the buildings on 9-11  
And a man named Bush on a search for weapons  
Now here come the U.S., to crush Saddam  
Wit 88 thousand tons of missile and bombs  
But his family's too broke to move or find shelter  
If they all had to die, they would die together and that's cold... damn

Bring heat in ridiculous ways never compromise  
Look into my eyes tell me what you see (what?)  
Victory ecstasy maybe Hennessy  
Energy wasted, enemies gettin' laced with

Self disciple Heineken let the record spin  
Paparazzi all over again, times ten

Full of well known villians that want to come home  
Never relax ain't no tellin' lay it on wax  
Make it bang let Stever sell 'em and dip 'em in chrome  
My nigga Bud'da chip off beats like cellular phones  
Heir to the thrown

And who you sleep with  
Might find yourself in deep shit  
So hit me with your best shot  
I'm lookin' forward to it

Sample a look back you look and find  
Nothing but rednecks for 400 years if you check  
Don't worry be happy  
Was a number one jam  
Damn if I say it you can slap me right here

I wanna kill you for your land, I don't mean to kill the reactor  
Linking in Japan, I am here, got the gangsta for all your chain chains  
March to the heart beat of the city  
You only hear the drums when they audace and they see me  
You know what time it is? Flavor with a thousand checks  
It's like the ice ring surrounds my neck  
I never worry about the referee, the gate keepers keep him locked for me  
Push all to shallow, forever  
Always will be underground X to the motherfucker Z  
Fold it all for the money, can't team, where my gangstars at?  
Hit the park, build at the car scene, blowing red everywhere  
Look how strong we are  
So there will be no war or shots  
I'm about to give my city boiling hot and make 'em pray for real  
And make 'em say my name, lit up more smoke than a power water drill  
Concentration, determination  
The very thin line between paradise and incarceration  
  
[Chorus]  
Gangsters, gangsters  
Gangsters, stand up and rap what you're claiming  
Police roll around, shake us down, always playing and I  
Gangsters, gangsters  
Streets made me into this man, gotta represent who I am  
  
They say right before you day you get the irry feeling of peace  
Then walk into the light  
My soul want me take it without a fight  
She says she wanna spend the whole life  
But she only got me here for one night  
Said it's time, better get it in. Call your best friend  
I'm a call you wonder-twins  
Stop and go like red light traffic, innovation made it another classic  
We made it happen  
And big hip hop want us gut cut  
Niggas dare too much than offense popped up  
Another game fucked up, because the lanes clocked up  
But the content sucks  
I wanna fill up some big red trucks, tour then through  
The whole world, motherfuckers lining up  
'Cause these tickets won't move like crap  
You're tying west coast around my back  
And y'all niggas saying fuck it with that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can't even rely on your own eyes, everything fake now  
Toast to the bad guys  
That will leave a whole class swimming with the fishes  
Part machine, part skill, part intuition  
I cooked my first album in my father's kitchen  
He told me how to make a living, twenty grand and half a chicken  
Now I'm shitting on myself and still I let him know  
That if he turn me in a turn around, it kill us both  
This is a cold world, but I'm a polar bear  
Destroy the earth like a silver flare, best beware of us  
In God we trust, but everybody else gotta pay cash up front  
Caught there, they try to tear me down  
I'm on a level now, I speak like I mean it, the focus study my literature  
Clean house, taking out the trash. I'm in the fly zone  
Where you past, gangsta?

Catch your mother or your sister comin out of the mall  
Bang holes through they coats and they Macy bags  
No retaliation you basically runnin with fags  
In these streets, you only good as your last transaction  
Funny style, and these niggaz ain't laughin

Hey Now, Hey Now  
  
Hey girl, look where I live  
40 acres and a Maybach Benz  
You wanted to party, but I got biz  
This ain't entertainin, I'm feedin my kids  
On a 4-oh-5 in the car pool lane  
Got to hit some corners, I'm ridin the cane  
Wanna ride out to a island, and tan your frame  
And just waste away a couple of days,  
Holla back at me!  
Look where I rap, make the crowd get loud like the sound of a gat  
LA on my baseball hat, where they wanna ride up on you in that black on black  
Move, betta, bounce like a mother  
When brother got mass weapons of war with each other  
X getting big, not ready to die yet, my militant mindset  
Got you runnin for cover  
  
Can you feel the speakers jumpin  
Other cats surroundin' but they won't say nothin  
Muggin in the club like they wanna do somethin  
Feelin kinda rowdy, huh?  
Hey Now, Hey Now  
All the girls mean muggin  
'Cause they musta seen what a girl pulled up in  
In the club like they wanna do somthin  
Feelin kinda rowdy, huh?  
Hey Now, Hey Now  
  
I'm the life of the party,  
I got a moon roof, we poppin up out of  
Look at the whole world they talkin about us  
I got a mean hook, to rattle ya body  
  
I wanna talk a little, pick ya brain  
Wanna see you in somethin little, walk around the plane  
I got a lot to gain, getting my record off the ground  
Like David Blaine  
So now, what you know bout me?, I'm a self-made man from poverty  
Now I own a lot of property  
I pimp rides, lifestyles, and companies  
Now let me spit you the facts  
I used to hustle the corner, but I ain't bringin you that  
I'm like swingin a bat, run at yo kneecaps for comin out ya face like that  
Baby girl touchin my chain, now let me tell you who I ain't  
Bitch you can't run no games, (A gangsta baby, ain't nothing changed)  
  
Can you feel the speakers jumpin  
Other cats surroundin' but they won't say nothin  
Muggin in the club like they wanna do somethin  
Feelin kinda rowdy, huh?  
Hey Now, Hey Now  
All the girls mean muggin  
'Cause they musta seen what a girl pulled up in  
In the club like they wanna do somthin  
Feelin kinda rowdy, huh?

Measure your height and your weight to break your neck with your hand  
Sometimes they use a shore drop or they use a crane  
Either way the victim dies in agonizing pain  
But if the calculations ain't correct when the rope's set  
The rope will rip the head right off the motherfucker's neck  
My appointment at the gallows x emerging from the shadows  
With a vendetta beetle who wanna battle  
Man you gon' get whipped in flaw shackle to an A-frame  
Beaten full force until you can't repeat your own name  
Till you smell the smell of burn and flesh  
Keep you alive until you pray for death  
Drawn in the corner disembowel until there's nothing left  
Saudi Arabia amputation for petty death  
Li chin translated this the leader in death  
A rubber tie filled with gas around your arms and chest  
Set you on fire turn your body to a melted mess  
Ask the AT about the south African necklace  
Go ahead and pick your poison it was coming to you  
Call me the prison bull I came to fucking kill you  
  
[Hook]  
  
Have must I come through merciless  
Be quick with that bullshit you heard of  
Uncut mole what have we ride through  
And always remember that death will come off swift wings  
Anyone who run contested now know have we now picked you whatever  
I came to peel  
  
Hands behind your back shackled then I forced you to kneel  
Shoot you in the back of the head send your family the bill  
For what the bullets cost I'm on my China shit  
Eye for an eye waterboard you like my government  
Impaled and left at the front gates  
Used to hear the sound of broken arms rib and leg makes  
Whipping and pull apart call it the breaking wheel  
By inquisition espanish mi corazon is free  
No compassion don't expect it when I fucking see you  
Lethal injections is my profession loading up my needles  
My iron maiden the Caucasian the Asian  
The information received by the ancient art of persuasion  
I'm 'bout to drop like a guillotine  
The cut is quick and clean I promise you won't feel a thing  
I'll never kiss the ring  
I rather storm the castle kill the king then set fire to fucking everything

I'm sorry I met you  
I'm sorry I hurt you  
I'm sorry I killed you  
I'm sorry I murked you  
Because I'm all alone now nobody is with me  
Nobody to threaten that they about come get me  
I wish I could go back to where we began  
I wish you was alive so I could kill you again  
I wish we had more paths to cross  
Nobody even cares if they survive my loss  
My killer's remorse  
  
For me we are the same should be laughed at  
Could be the very fame shit to get your bitch ass clacked  
You fell slick next now drowning in your own pool out back  
I kick the cats and dog tube the shit I don't count that  
You're my angel of death I strangle till there's no breath  
I kill the kill kill till there ain't nobody left  
My conscience don't inhibit me I kill deliberately  
Just wanna be like God, cause God kills indiscriminately  
I'm so christian I'm so muslim  
Super size on your mom trigger get push up  
I'm parallel to hell I'm ready so Satan what's cooking  
And rappers running their mouth they don't know how close their bitch ass is
coked  
To get turned in ghosts nigga I will kill you  
Don't get it cross memories fade just as blood washes off  
I said memories fade just as blood washes off  
Hope to see you soon

I feel so guilty my hands are filthy  
From decorating your face all over the building  
I'm staying sincere if I ain't making it clear  
I'm writing on the wall with the blood man I wished you were here  
But you moved on at your funeral I beat you with slam  
I hugged your mom tell your sister and her kids to be clam  
I will tell 'em you gone you just sleep in a dream and all c'est la vie  
We smoked you like the weed in the bong  
  
Have you ever seen the bloodstain  
And know that person has returned from every once came  
Regret is such an ugly thing only if you let it fuck with your brain  
But it ain't gonna change a fucking thing  
What's done is done chop that shit up to the game  
You're still dead when I'm still alive  
And I never got the chance to utilize my best alibi  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Started the bullshit escalated to violence  
In result of the violence infinite permanent silence  
Now I feel empty not even existing  
My worst enemy is no longer against me  
I remember the hatred and how it consumed me  
And you felt the same thing but never could move me  
A shot to the face is nothing like in the movies  
The back of your brain is out the body keeps moving  
So I should rejoice now because you are past tense  
The last of my enemies the last of you bastards  
The dirt on your casket  
I'm so alone now you were the reason to carry my danger my chrome out  
And I just sold out and wait for the contact  
And life for the combat and now we be on that  
And I'd take it all back if I knew what I knew now  
What's a shooter without somebody to shoot down

All bark no bite (SHIIIT!) we don't bark nigga

Hard work and sacrifice, who's your daddy?

Sawed-off shotgun, shoot through your shoulderblade  
Bitch-made niggaz get, hit with a hand grenade  
Blow up your Escalade, then I hit the road  
and I'm back in the hood lookin for somethin to smoke  
Everytime, I use the element of surprise  
With a gun that's big enough to make an elephant hide  
I elevate my rhythm by hustlin crack addicts  
Get locked but, when I'm released I'm back at it  
See, Mitch know the time, in front of me the birdie and

Always got a cup in my hand

Lets have a conversation on my present situation  
I don't need to be a star, I got my own constellation  
Professional inebriation, we having a celebration  
A live nation and heavy rotation  
Patience  
Hold more information than a free mason  
It's a secret society, never try sobriety

black man were comin' torward you  
what would you be feeling?

""I don't want niggas soundin' like me knowhatI'msayin'?"" (x2)  
  
Xzibit:  
Yo we gettiin' restless me and D.O.G.s  
Never pretendin' rather we sendin' a very clear message  
Either you with me or against me punk hit 'em up  
Provide housin' for these shrimp from the shells we dump

Til we takin' advantage of inflicting irreversable damage  
It's the long awaited anticipated Likwit MC  
Bombin' first cause I feel it's better to give then receive  
You better believe  
Xzibit stays savage above the average  
When niggas try to switch turn bitch for the cabbage  
But see all that irrelevant it's like tryin' to turn a whore celibate  
I dance with the devil for the hell of it  
Burning down your lavish lanndscape on digital tape  
Cause everything you rhymin' about is actually fake  
So make room for the legitimate nasty inconsiderate  
Thinkin' you rankin' top dollar but really counterfeit  
  
Hook  
  
Montageone:  
Niggas we null and void I get swole like a keyloid  
To overload your system with rhymes for millenniums  
To shut down artists with beats the deep closure  
Battlin' top rank for bank and exposure  
So open up your door to me Cause if it's closed  
I'm a brakin' in with some pantyhose  
Over the mic  
So you don't know who I sound like  
Executing those who record and bite to sound tight  
It's not permitted by the right  
The Gustopo surprising these niggas like Benny Blanco  
Remember me man? You thought I was a fan till I threw you in the back of a  
van  
Yo these Drop Squad delegates rhymes are delicate  
I spit on the mic to get these MC's pussys wet  
For those with plans to clone me thee original  
It can't be done I'm digital (digital)  
  
Hook  
  
Xzibit:  
Yo who want to come see the hard rock?  
The non stop green block yo whole block receive speed knot  
You need not  
Get brave my bullets never graze  
They hit close to home separating flesh from bone  
So better get off on your own bitch  
Rollin' chrome shit tryin't to own shit  
I was molded, after the best that the streets had to offer  
The author of my own destiny  
So I suggest you stop stressin' me  
I'll find out when I pull my nine out and blow your mind out  
Play a deadly game with no fouls and no time outs  
Inhale large amounts of dojah forever ready like a soldier  
I'm lock mode and shoot from the shoulder  
And burn down your lavish landscape digital tape  
Cause everything you rhyme about is actually fake  
So make room for the legitimate nasty inconsiderate  
Thinkin' you rankin' top dollar but really counterfeit

He's too advanced for his own good  
He didn't get a second chance to see the glock pointed at his hood  
Makin' his way through the rain he's caught in the game  
He felt the pain of a slug to the back of the brain  
Nothin's changed in a city flask  
Where niggas lurk in black shirts pants and low hats, forever  
Until the job is done and no one's left  
My man Jeff told me with his very last breath  
To watch moms  
But they got her with the car bomb  
Pop tried to save her second blast got his arm  
Niggas play for keeps like casino  
Baby's has got fathers just got back from doin' Chino  
With nothin' to lose loose screws in the attic  
The only skill a nigga knows is how to strip an automatic  
And stash the barrel stab a nigga something terrible  
Death resume 20 kill in incredible time  
No guilt and shame  
On the mind stuck a nigga for lookin' didn't know he was blind  
So I find  
Mankind is a serious threat  
To another others kind when there's something to get  
In a vet gonna fast jet to the spot to see what they got  
Nobody saw shit cause it's not  
Cool to brake the rule of the code of the streets  
Niggas frightened by the visions of the blood on the sheets  
And it's deep how blood drys as a mother crys  
Open eyes gettin' landed on by flys  
There's no disgues for the ones who harassin'

But season after season they recycle assassins now  
  
I came from a family of one girl and three boys  
Fuck playin' with toys our fun was on the block  
Watchin' all the cats negotate the neighborhood stock  
My job was to come runnin' whenever cops was comin'  
My older brother I figure was the ring leader  
Whenever these cats move they all bring heaters  
All black and nickel plated (c'mon)  
Soon became fasinated bitches cars and kicks  
And look at how fast they made it  
My younger brother gave less than a fuck he was content  
With G.I. Joe and Tonka trucks  
But I want butts, livin' first class delux  
15 years old soldier ready to serve these clucks  
My older brother was touched  
It's a game where you don't play gotta have cane  
Crack house for my birthday  
The next day my brother shot in cold blood by the police  
In a rage he lived but he payed the price  
Caught with keys 25 to life  
Takin' in by the crew time to standed on my own two (c'mon nigga)  
But as I marinated thinkin' about the hood  
I really can't remember my body doin' good  
For long big decisions somebody got to make 'em  
Undercover recognize the face now can't shake a  
Phone tap (what) and now I'm in the belly of the beast  
Use to sittin' in leather sheets now I'm sittin' awaitin' release  
Visitors day, my younger brother came down  
Put the toys down excited about the first round  
He bust I was crushed to finally see  
The solution to the problem could of started with me  
It's on now  
  
There's no escape from the ones who harassin'

Cause she, cuss me out, quick to leave me  
Cause she, not what I want, not what I want, not what I need  
Cause she, blow my phone up, to reach me  
Cause she, tried to lock, now she leaves me  
Cause she, not what I want, not what I want, not what I need  
  
Man, X aint' with that sucka shit  
I'm from a place, where they quick to say ""Fuck A Bitch""  
And gettin' grits, off of pussy, try ta get a hitch  
But I'm a bachelor, stackin' it, drinkin', need to quit  
Me and my clique, ride through cities like we own the shit  
You caught my eye, looking fly, body lookin' thick  
So who am I? I reply with my government, exchange the numbers  
Escapades for days, satisfying my hunger  
Don't trip, you from a long list, a long line  
Get in line, you so fucking fine, you spendin' time  
Introduce you as a friend of mine, never my woman  
I got twenty twenty cord vision, seein' you comin'  
Livin' my life, I don't need a wife  
But you persist, tryin' ta strengthen our relationship  
But I'm a dog, and a dog gotta run the streets  
Without a leash, this ain't workin' so I'm sayin' peace  
You ain't the one for me!

You found some way to hold on, through all the bullshit  
Never seen a woman so strong, I used to pull shit  
Now them days, long been gone, I gotta move in them streets  
Provide a place for all my peoples to eat  
I'm feelin' stuck, had to hustle up  
The ATF hit the house, had me shackled up  
You lost your mind, hate the time, I was in and out  
You never let a brother down, when you stressin' out  
You stressin' wanted me, to figure out a different route  
You could've left, but you a rider and stuck it out  
And it's a trip, because it's like you never missed a beat  
You waited anxiously, patiently, stayin' strong for me  
I sat aside, thinking back to the way I was  
The way I am, and how I gotta be a stronger man  
I understand that you love me and you want the best  
But if you want to take the good, you gotta take the rest  
I rock a vest, baby!  
  
Cause I, run these streets for my struggle  
Cause I, carry heat for my troubles  
Cause I, is that what you want, is that what you want, is that what you need?  
Cause I, want family so I'm buildin'  
Cause I, want futures for my children  
Cause I, is that what you want, is that what you want, is that what you need?  
  
And all this time it was you  
Baby forgive me for the pain, I was puttin' you through  
It's me and you against the world, so I'm keepin' it true  
I know I haven't been the best, the wrong things I pursue  
I used to think I was the MAN, wasn't havin' a clue  
I wasn't lookin' for no love, but I found it in you  
It's so true, behind every great man is a women  
Every time you call me, Baby Girl, I'm a come runnin'  
You got a soldier livin' right, girl you saved my life  
I sacrifice, anything to keep my family tight  
I seen the light, and when the world try to beat me down  
You always given me another reason, I can smile  
Cause you believed in me, when there was nothin' there to see  
My wife can be my better half, complete my family tree  
Ugh, nothin' can stop us now, Vera Wang gown  
Watchin' your father, walk his little lady down the isle  
Cause you the one for me!  
  
Cause she, was put here to complete me  
Cause she, wooze the earth, underneath me  
Cause she, got what I want, got what I want, got what I need  
Cause she, won't let go, she won't leave me  
Cause she, won't leave, what she don't need me  
Cause she, got what I want, got what I want, got what I need

Drink a gallon of heaty, throw it up with the hood  
I'm a rhyme for my people, give my people a voice  
Never follow the leader, use the weapon of choice  
This is not an illusion, this is not a mirage  
Conversation with God, spilling my soul out  
I own assault weapons that fall down like Megatron  
The iron mob, try better bombs, I'm better alone

Smoke to the sack of gold, nigga on a grind

I'm coming back with a gun, cause I saw that I know  
Meditated intentions, my shit ready to go  
Never taking a smoke, in my profession you need aggression  
A weapon, you can brand the shit to your own discretion  
And I hear, just a sandwich, nigga, what's your preference?  
I chose bad and now I'm headed in a right direction  
They're sick of the decisions, now my family is good  
Make you well understood, put you back where you should be

Enough with all this swagger, party's a baggy bagger  
We hear a session is starting, let me show you what's heading at  
Money's so fucking tight, the root to all them fights  
She make you wanna not ever, not ever come home at night  
But she know that you go off with that stripping ho  
While your woman is wondering where does all your money go  
You try to make it rain, maybe lock you a chain  
Maybe inducing brain from bitches everywhere  
Pussy nigga, you lame, get on top of your game  
Feed your family, man, this is simple and plain  
Children retain, remember living upon the pain  
That's when they curse your name, they will see you do the same

Better put the word out, mind I find the mediocre  
I'm a bust it down, serve 'em like a bunch of smokers  
You can fuck around, who else get the fly  
You know I asked your little mind is your prime world dying over  
  
[Chorus]  
Order in the court, that's what you came to see  
The state of hip hop versus mister X to the Z  
Not a verdict to see, just the moment of truth  
Fighting the fight of my life, jury ready to shoot  
I be my own attorney, watching you try to burn me down  
Testimony testifier from the underground  
Order in the court, that's what you came to see  
The state of hip hop versus mister X to the Z  
  
I create in a dark, darkest place in my heart  
I finish off with your started terror, I tear you apart  
I am not for the cage, I'm the climb to the change  
Dread the eye and the needle, that means accurate aim  
That means I can arrange haters and hideous things  
I'm the sickness you feel, sickness from popping a vein  
Paranormal presence to people who can never explain  
Why deal with the devil when dealing with you is the same  
I got a proposition for all you bitches listening  
Get in position, let me nail it like a crucifixion  
Give you what you've been missing  
A man in my condition shouldn't be allowed around crowds without supervision  
Call it a superstition, can't get this out my system  
I got a fetish for fucking over my opposition  
It's time to set the standing, the mother ship is landing  
We didn't come here in peace, we're here to take the player  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I came up with the wolf, they came out with them tools  
Elevate you out the earth gravitational pool  
This is not for the week, this time works for the streets  
Mister X to the Z, motherfuck, what you think?  
Motherfuck, what you blog, this for my loss and my dogs  
Standing tall, still calling shots from behind the wall  
I've been tried and I'm true, reassemble my crew  
Carry on tradition, position I'm put here to do  
Make movements my elemental, I did make some improvements  
You can check my potential, tool to never pursue it  
If I listen to critics, there would be no Xzibit  
Dreams splattered and broken never breaking my spirit  
Listen close, you can hear it, the footsteps of the future  
Ain't no time like the present, live the past and excuses  
Fucked on anything, fuck it, I keep it exclusive  
You just saw as if acoustic, this that real nigga music

My life like a Hitchcock flick, stick to the script  
If she can't stick to the script, stick to this dick  
How she actin off of the fifth? Ridiculous shit

If you here on vacation we got, rules and regulations  
Seperate myself from y'all, segregation  
Tryin to stop Xzibit and Dre? Humiliation  
Pure elevation, got me some inspiration  
Two bitches in bubble baths, a beautiful invitation  
Got a live occupation, live for the moment  
I'm faced with an altercation manhandlin my opponents

Watch out for fake hits and bullshit that sounds identical  
Pick it up, read the credits, who you thought it was?

This product not to be sold

You can flip it and come back with a mitt  
Don't make me reach through your limo tint  
I just want my twenty percent  
This is dedicated to the people that spoke too soon  
I think I'll stop shootin you niggaz and shoot for the moon

Organized minds, organize they nickels and dimes

Say boy, you know that you'll pay the price

God, please could you arm me with the armor  
To calm me when there's drama like Gandhi?  
Could have gone the other way many times  
Could have turned Dalai with the lama  
But I squashed my beefs and things seem to be looking decent  
Recently, but don't jinx it  
It's like Clint Eastwood looking for peace though  
Maybe not finna enter  
The priesthood, but at least should  
Make an attempt to show some remorse  
And to be some sort of a repenter  
For the people I've been a minister  
Not a preacher, but a shit starter and finisher  
Into the mind of a thick skin, but a short temper  
This patience of mine is thinner  
Than twine is when I get attacked  
So I might say something back that might offend you  
So if you don't like when I rap  
Or what I have to say on the mic then you  
Might wanna act just like quarterbacks  
And take a fuckin' hike when I snap cause I'm a sinner  
(I got a best friend, best friend)  
Plus balls and intestines  
And they never been yes men  
They gon' tell me when I'm fuckin' up  
The minute I'm ever giving it less than  
I'm about to vomit and I can feel it coming  
Cause failure's something I can barely stomach  
And I only listen to my gut  
So unless you're my fuckin' belly button  
Don't tell me nothin'  
You ain't my (best friend, best friend)  
Who you think I'm talking 'bout?  
Lifts me up when I'm down and out  
Still look to him without a doubt  
Still got a (best friend, best friend)  
Shout it out like there's never been a louder mouth  
Should have never been allowed a mouth  
Now that I got a higher power  
Now when I blackout, power outage  
They powerless, but they crowd around  
They tend to flock like shepherds  
The black sheep  
But I be the worst thing that these motherfuckers ever heard  
When I'm counted out  
You be D-O-A, they'll announce  
But pronounce you dead when they sound it out  
So prepare for a rival, your arch enemy surrounds you now  
He's all around you  
Not even the doctors at the hospital  
Are gonna shiggy-shock you back to life  
It's im-piggy-possible to revive you  
That's word to the diggy doc  
Stiggy-stopping is not an option  
Something I'm not gonna do  
I'm the Iggy Pop of hip-hop when I walk in the booth  
Dawg, I'm the truth like Biggie rockin' with 2Pac in the suit  
Talking to Proof dropping a deuce  
Fill up a syllable clip like a refillable script, cock and I shoot  
Who you think's my Glock that I use?  
That I pull from to get my strength up against these haters  
And he'll be waiting at the gate when you get sprayed up  
Sending you hoes straight up to deal with my (best friend)

This one's for the bad girls tryna go good  
  
[Chorus]  
How can someone like me so bad just touch a good girl  
Touch a good girl, you're a good girl  
And I know that I don't treat you like I should girl  
Like I could girl, like my good girl  
  
Here I go again, on my shit again  
Walking through the mall, acting like a prick again  
You had a halter top, I had my Famous socks  
You came to shop, I came to ho hop  
You had your girl with you, both looking great  
I wanted both of y'all, how 'bout a double take  
She was hating, looking at me like a scumbag  
But something made you wanna turn around and come back  
Probably cause I just don't give a fuck  
I just wanna see one of these hookas in my truck  
So tell your girlfriend ""tough luck""  
She just wanna see you with somebody dressed up well  
I really ain't into that type of shit  
I'm into tattoos, drink til six  
Fuck until nine, sleep until twelve  
And going back to my homies with a story to tell  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This shit should've been finished  
I'm as surprised as you are that you still let me in it  
But you continue to text message me  
Right after saying that we should move separately  
But you don't wanna see me go  
Even though I've only given you dick and cold cereal  
So you must have a thing for Lucky Charms  
Or the bad girl in you just fell in my lucky arms  
You love to cuss me out and call me crazy  
Say I'm no good and all of your friends hate me  
Then you show up to my room and damn near rape me  
And then it goes from ""fuck you"" to ""fuck me baby""  
You leave early so nobody sees you out the spot  
Now you stuck between a hard place and a rock  
You call me a player but I have lied to you not  
Cause I'm not a player, I just crush a lot, holler  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm in jail again, on my Johnny Cash  
Some dude was talking shit, I had to whoop his ass  
Called you in the morning and you just fucking laughed  
You think this cute, you love my crazy ass  
And I wonder if you'll ever leave my side  
Cause the more that I ignore you, the more you wanna ride  
I tell you that I'm bad but you never ask why  
Cause you just want the good from a really bad guy  
You wanna rock, let's rock and roll, just know  
I'm only good at one thing and that's not control  
But I am consistent, that's something to be proud of  
Cause I ain't shit with you and I ain't shit without you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To all the bad girls, trying to go good  
No such thing as a good girl gone bad  
Just a bunch of bad girls tryna go good  
Holler at me, mane

Ain't got a whole lot but I'ma show it off  
Better recognize game, lets roll, lets roll  
  
Yeah, now let me welcome you to my small town  
Big trucks in the yard, big bucks on the wall, country folks all around  
How I was raised, eight oh eight drums quaking, they shake that box, eighty

Yeah and the dope boys hotter than hells gate, but I, still in the shade  
With a fold out chair, a thirty pack on the back of that tailgate  
A-L-A, B-A-M-A I'm off I might pee in the lake  
I might go to Talladega and see me a race  
And bring me case, yeah I'm bringing a case, I'm gettin' throwed off

And I'm all the way throwed off  
Z-seventy one take the bow off  
Dipped in mossy oak, with a mullet Mohawk  
Yeah, with a bright orange hat, and a bag underneath that Chevy seat  
Yeah buddy, might go off, split you like a bowling ball  
Split you in my overalls  
Yeah home of the gumbo, got a couple folks that'd do it to you for hundo'  
And when them elephant feet rumble  
That Dixie cups gonna fall off the console  
You don't wanna have a convo' and not understand that 'Bama slanguage  
Like hollerin' ain't it, but I come to paint it, so it won't be throwed off?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm just a kid that rocks  
I'm just a boy with a dream  
That bet it all with the last bill that I had hid in my socks  
Used to keep a twenty two in a shoebox  
Now I bang Beretta  
She's 22 and I keep her in a tube top  
White trash and all, take us all the way to the top and then laugh it off  
Like how the fuck did I get a catalog with more hits than a fucking jackhammer

Cause I planned it all, Crimson tide standing tall  
Shit, I'm another lit cannon ball  
Fuck around and I'm going off and I'm getting throwed off

I got me bitch  
  
Both of us was in the same class in oh two Antioch Nash-Ville,  
And I wanted you so bad  
That I forgot to mind my manners  
Everybody wanted them panties  
Every guy was hopin' to land it  
We would flirt around and touch hands  
Until we fucked around and took Xanex  
And that's when you began to drive me bananas  
I was in denial it's apparent  
You began to lie to your parents  
You should know that I can't live  
Without you holdin' my name  
Now my heart's in control of my brain  
And I can't hold it in the lanes  
  
Rollin' down 20 man  
With this Jack in my cup, feelin' down on my luck  
And I'm doin 120 man  
Maybe I'm givin' up, baby I'm givin up

Don't you believe in us? Don't you believe in us?

But love is not enough, love is not enough, love is not enough  
  
Used to fuck so much we missed school  
You was there when I needed you  
I was there when you needed me  
We were inseparable  
And I was broke with no fuckin' food  
You was tough enough to be cool  
Skate holes all in my shoes  
Dope boys had me confused  
I was in love with hip-hop  
You was in love with that to  
What made it come to a stop  
Had to have been the money issue, bitch  
And I really miss the rain  
I gave you all of my soul and I got left was a key chain

Who the fuck are you fuckin' now  
Bet he's always takin' you out  
College educated and proud  
Me, well I'm just a drop out  
Can't really blame you for buggin'  
Ain't I the dirt on your rug and  
Just a place to wipe your shoes  
And give me all your thrown away lovin'  
Back to my buzzin' and druggin'  
Back to my gutter with nothin'  
Back to the rut all of a sudden  
cracks in the covenant trust in me  
You ain't gotta worry bout sharin' this success with Wayne  
Now it's just petty change  
But I still feel the pain

and pause  
What the fuck man I can never get sleep man, peeped out the window what's
wrong with y'all?  
Stood up in my Crimson Tide Alabama sweat pants and threw my pillow  
Looks like daddy caught the motherfucker that tried to sneak in and steal his
elbows  
They don't know that old man don't hold hands or throw hands naw he's rough
like a brilo  
Went to the Chevy and pulled out a machete and that gun is heavy and tall as
the midget willow

You know we sippin on that old brown bottle, bass in the trunk make the whole

So when we ride around bitches follow, but tonight one of the bitches is
giving us problems  
Well one of them bitches be fuckin' one of my homeboys favorite bitches  
And has been on his hit list for a minute and I think he's ready to handle his
business  
He told me Yelawolf get this and he handed me the Cartier watch that was on

He said watch this shit and he jumped to the trunk and grabbed his biscuit,

One falls down to the ground, one walks down to the road  
Momma better call the police  
Now he's screaming no  
Took a buckshot to the chest with a rock salt shell and he's moving slow  
All this blood has spilled, enough to give a penguin chills  
Hot enough to make a potato smoke at the tip of a hollowed steel  
In the valley of the hollowed field  
In the valley of the hollowed 'til  
This ain't a figment of my imagination buddy, this is where I live Bama!

Yelawolf,Radio,/y/yelawolf/radio_20988583.html,"[Chorus]  
I can't seem to get you off my mind  
Turn on the station, but I'm still facing you and  
Everbody seem to lost their mind  
It's hard to handle, so I, change the channel on the  
Radio, 'cause internet killed the radio star  
Radio, and YouTube, killed the video star  
Hit the radio  
We can make a, make a video  
Now I'm a star  
Hit the radio  
We can make a, make a video  
Now I'm a star  
  
Picture me rollin' Pac, it's funny how time has changed  
Everybody's a critic now, it's all a debate on the internet wave  
It used to be you and Biggie, Chili Pepper's ""Give It Away""  
Now we got ten year-olds sitting back in a chair like ""those were the days""  
And though it seems so amazing to me that the labels lost the touch  
And I'm in the AM, flipping through the A.M. like I lost my crutch, limpin'  
Cause I can't walk straight if I can't turn it up, sippin'  
I need some Gin and Juice, Snoop Dogg, I brought my cup  
What's up, ah ha, okay, shut up  
Cause I think we had enough of radios and lunch with the love bugs  
Well let me give you a big hug  
Bag of mushrooms, here, take some drugs  
And play some group home or something  
And shit goodie mobs sould food is bumpin' rewind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You'll never hear Black Star cause the program director is mostly deaf  
And you'll never hear triple six cause we live in the midst of the Bible Belt  
But that's when the light is filled, so let it shine  
Let em' rhyme, let em' hustle, let em grind  
Nothing wrong with the truth sometimes  
Sometimes, the truth is dark but the darkness sparks the truest art  
And you didn't even know you a window till a tornado blew it apart  
If Eric Clapton could sing about cocaine, then there's no harm  
Then I can write about guns, I can rap about girls  
I can sing about money and cars  
Not that my money is large  
Let's talk about broke is a joke  
Let's talk about gettin' evicted, everything owned thrown out on the road  
And maybe that there goes gold  
Shit maybe it's platinum sold  
But they don't want to see the green leaves from pirates gold  
Oh no, hold up rewind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Pick up the change, pick up the change  
Ride in a Chevy cause I'm sick of the Range  
Catfish Billy come pick up the name  
Come inside, if your sick of the rain  
Turn the radio off and don't complain  
It's all a replay, it's all the same  
Got one drag, on a runaway train  
On a one way street better pick your lane  
  
Yeah, but you could let me pick your brain  
And we could be that Rolling Stone  
Mix 'em up with Janis Joplin  
Let 'em harmonize like Bone  
Or we could just leave it alone  
Let it take on a life of it's own  
Or we could be that World Class Wreckin' Cru  
Tell 'em to turn the lights back on  
C'mon

You know what? (you know what?)  
  
You're like the hardest thing I've ever seen  
And I'm from the gutter so believe me  
I've seen some hard things  
You come from where the black flower grows  
I wanted to cut you down and take you home  
Call me Axl Rose  
I could see you in a 1976 Camaro  
Me and you, sipping whiskey, getting drunker than Jack Sparrow  
Is Black Sabbath, how you get mellow huh  
Well put your feet on my Harley Davidson pedals  
And rock and roll girl  
  
[Chorus]  
Like a diamond cuts through a pearl  
This the hardest rap song in the world (hardest love song)  
You could get it in with your girl  
You're the hardest rap song in the world (hardest love song)  
  
You don't got to drive a Fleetwood Cadillac  
You just got to know some words to Fleetwood Mac  
Horror movies turn you on, pull the sheets back  
Fuck it, I role play, do it to you in a Jason mask  
You switch walkers like a switch blade  
You walk into the room and it's like these other bitches get hit with a
grenade  
With that said, let me pull the spandex pants off you with my teeth like Ozzy
did a bat head  
I rock and roll, baby let's go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You ain't concerned with new clothes or salaries  
You would rather run across the country like Mickey and Mallory  
Being the natural born killer that you are  
We'll hang out the window with a pistol and I drive the car  
Who would bother to bother the general with nothing but snack food  
Shooting everything that moves, dogs and cats too  
Reenact the hardest movie scenes, bloody shirts and holy jeans  
We the hardest you and me, rock and roll baby

Yelawolf,The Last Song,/y/yelawolf/the+last+song_20988496.html,"Everybody's asking me lately where I'm from  
They wanna know what I've been through and what dirt I've done  
But man if I told you what I've seen and been through then you probably run
off  
If your scared of the truth so instead in secret lined in chalk  
See I've been lost ever since I could walk  
Looking for my daddy and anyone of mamma's boyfriends who would talk  
Or listen to me when I spoke instead of looking at me like a joke  
Leaving me behind leaving me to cry when you treated my momma like a ho  
But I learned quick that my daddy wasn't ever gonna come around  
And I didn't give a shit 'cause me and my momma we held it down  
No new kicks first day of school I'm goodwill bound  
But when you come from the trench that's how you learn to walk around  
So I don't give a fuck if you ever lay eyes on top of my new shoes homey  
I just wanted you to know I didn't need a dollar from you I got 'em myself  
So if you find yourself in the middle of the floor with the bottle drinking
yourself lonely  
Then you can keep company with the picture of me in the magazine on the shelf
turn the page  
  
[Chorus]  
Daddy can you see me? I'm putting on a show  
In the magazines, hear me on the radio  
So what do you think huh?  
(Well I hope that your proud now, to watch it all go down)  
I'm sorry daddy you didn't get to watch me grow  
Now I'm always on the road no time to say hello  
Bye (and I hope that your proud now, to watch it all go down)  
  
Yeah mamma you look great, perfect  
Be safe on your first date, for certain  
If he brings you home too late, I'll hurt him  
Don't worry bout me I'm safe I'll close the curtains  
And I feel like I'm raising you but what do I know baby blue  
All I know is that I was made in you so I put all my faith in you  
Yeah I was only ten but I felt like a man and I had to let you go  
All I wanted was for us to be rich tear drops in my cereal bowl  
So I turned into an asshole young and dumb smoking weed  
Vandalizing, robbing houses, stealing cars, that was me  
But everything I did I had to see  
Feel the pain, had to grieve  
To become who I am and I'm proud of the man I came to be  
What I've learned cannot be taught  
What I've earned cannot be bought  
Justified deserve it all  
So don't be concerned it's not your fault  
I never counted sheep I count my blessings  
So if you see him now momma don't give him the cold shoulder just give him my
message just tell him

But Target was closed so I decided to mosey on over to K-Mart, but the doors  
Was locked, what about some shoes I thought, great I suppose  
So I go to Payless but what'dya know, they didn't carry a size eight in hoes!  
Oh! This is ugly boy swag, puttin' toe tags on you motherfuckin' ho bags

Some airplane gliding into one of the bigger clouds over Manhattan

The Wall Street boys wearing their ties around their neck  
Like boxer's towels after a fight

And started preaching like a monk from another world  
After some minutes, he had a little crowd  
Which disappeared when a police car passed by slowly  
Like rolling gloom  
And Mr. Toomy throws his voice 'til he was the only one in the area

Yello,Beyond Mirrors,/y/yello/beyond+mirrors_20148284.html,"The age of science has failed  
To explain our universe in rational terms.  
  
Consequently the power of magic  
Has gradually emerged from our conscious minds  
To fathom the unfathomable.  
  
Our most distinguished scientists  
Reluctantly admit that mankind is nothing  
But some billion creatures,  
Sitting on a piece of solar driftwood floating in space.  
  
Magic is the art of influencing the course  
Of events by the intervention  
Of spiritual forces or some other occult device.  
  
According to Arthur C. Clarke  
Any sufficiently advanced technology  
Is indistinguishable from magic.  
  
Early civilization often mistook  
The unexplainable world around them to be magic.  
  
Rupert Sheldrake in his book  
Seven experiments that could change the world  
Has stated that scientists' attitude  
Toward their experiments affect  
The results of their experiments.  
  
There is no such thing as a definite  
Fact in science and therefore the irrationality of magic  
Plays an important part in our rational world.  
  
Werner Heisenberg, the leading 20th century  
Physicist has stated that mass  
Is a physical interpretation of energy.  
  
Religious organizations have understood the power of magic  
And therefore monopolized the interpretation  
Of the supernatural to control the human mind.  
  
The universe as a whole is beyond explanation.  
  
Only at the end of the 20th. century  
The Roman-Catholic Church admitted,  
That the great visionary Galileo Galilei was in fact correct.  
  
The second millennium has come to an end.  
Scientists have to admit that the universe is magic.

Tonight we're visiting the home of a very famous motion picture  
And television director  
Dr. Van Steiner, I'm very sorry I'm unable to attend this tremendous  
Occasion being given in your honor  
I would like to extend my sincerest best wishes to you

Inside an iron ball  
Desire

We see the moon  
A color ball  
We won't be free again  
No choice  
  
An iron box  
Electric brain release  
Away, away, away, away  
  
A piece of steel  
That's all we ever feel  
No pain

We see the moon  
A color ball  
We won't be free again

The Amazonas full of piranhas  
The birds of paradise  
Disappear into the green desert  
For years and years  
We are hungry and desperate  
For the only thing worth living  
The excess  
We end our Great Mission  
Exhausted and sad  
And there is no hope left  
When suddenly  
In a cloud of golden smog  
The father of excess  
Jumps out of the water of  
The Amazonas full of piranhas  
And screams to the lost souls  
  
What are you doing at the Amazonas  
Leave Manaus full of piranhas [burp!]  
You will not find excess in the jungle  
  
And then  
He opened the green curtain  
Made of fleshy leaves and said  
  
I show you the excess of the  
Asphalt a Montmartre  
The excess of the belly-dance  
In Abu Dhabi  
And the excess of the everlasting night in Manhattan [burp!]  
  
Are you ready for the sensation del tango a Rosario?  
Leave him, the gorilla  
Leave the jungle of the Amazonas  
Leave Manaus full of piranhas  
And follow father excess.

The sun is still around  
The street seems to be busy  
I hear the traffic sounds

I had a lot to drink  
Too many dry martinis  
And cans of beer to sink  
  
Another day, already night  
Blue neon light  
Blue neon light  
  
I could call my Rhianna  
Ask her to meet me now  
I think I lost her number  
It's too late anyhow

Or I could stay in bed

Soft wind  
Sunlight  
And I was red  
  
On the papers  
On the floor  
We did watch possessed  
  
People, push and pull it  
Moss turf, and other lads  
My head's still full of poison  
What I do is insane  
I should, perhaps, move out of here  
Or take a plane to Spain  
  
Refrigerator's noise  
I'll get out, the only choice  
Should I get up right now  
Wait for me somehow  
Don't want to know what for  
To get out of this door  
Should I phone Debbie Meier?  
Is this the one desire?  
I look into the mirror  
My eyes can't be in error  
The sun's now really gone  
Perhaps I am the one  
Nothing can creep in sight  
I'm turning on the lights  
  
Turning on the lights  
I'm turning on the lights (5x)

Perhaps I am the one

But I know what you think of me  
Yeah, you had a breakthrough and now I'm just bad news for you

I should've told you everything  
I never gave you anything  
I should've told you everything  
If I could give you anything  
Then I would tell you everything  
  
I wish I could be somebody else  
I wish I could see you in myself  
I wish there was something inside me to keep you beside me  
And say what you really feel  
You know I need something that's real

It started out in the last slow motion scene watching everyone change.  
Made a map of the one way road from here, I had no reason to stay.  
  
I am awake and alive there is something calling me.  
More than a moment in time, it's a dream I'm following on my own.  
(On my own) On my own.  
More than a moment in time, it's a life of leaving home.  
  
Think of me when the stars come out tonight, take a look at the sky.  
I never said I could burn out that bright, but I needed to try.

Back when we built something new  
The world was ours to conquer  
And we were not afraid to lose ourselves  
Somewhere inside this, you changed  
And I could never follow you that way  
  
I miss you madly and it's raining on the coast  
I'm supposed to say ""this was your loss"", and ""I'm fine""

Quiet is my loudest cry  
Wouldn't want to wake the eyes that make me melt inside  
And if it's healthier to leave you be  
May a sickness come and set me free  
Kill me while I still believe that you were meant for me  
  
I'm finding my own words, my own little stage  
My own epic drama, my own scripted page  
I'll send you the rough draft, I'll seal it with tears  
Maybe you'll read it and I'll reappear  
From the start it was shaky and the characters rash,  
A nice setting for heartache where emotions come last  
All I have deep inside, to overcome this desire  
Are friendly intentions and fair-weather smiles  
  
And I don't want to be, don't want to be wrong  
You're leaving me, you're leaving me in lieu of this song  
Don't want to be, don't want to be wrong  
You're leaving me, you're leaving me in lieu of this, in lieu of this song

Moving in that first apartment  
It felt like it was never gonna end  
Both so lost and crazy  
We were young so we ran  
Now I live in a dream where I am  
Holding your little hands  
I never got to meet you, my best friend  
  
You would be ten and I'd be  
Driving you to school  
You would tell all your friends  
That you thought I was cool  
You would be out in the sun  
Until it was gone  
You would be watching Star Wars  
With your PJ's on  
And you would have  
All the love in my heart  
Yeah, you would have  
All the love in my heart  
  
Mm  
Mm  
  
Don't you think we would have been best friends?  
  
You would be ten and I'd be  
Driving you to school  
You would tell all your friends  
That you thought I was cool  
You would be out in the sun  
Until it was gone  
You would be watching Star Wars  
With your PJ's on  
You would be playing tunes on  
On your first guitar  
You would be harmony to  
Every single part of me  
And you have  
All the love in my heart  
Yeah, you would have  
All the love in my heart

Taking back instead of giving, taking back more or less  
Taking back a sense of being afraid  
So all this necessary changes now, as the will to help all man  
And the children of the crucified will better off, better dead  
  
But all this senseless killing, and all these chains and lies  
I want to know right now, I want to know right now  
I want to know where we come from

She took it out on God and laid her soul to hell and let the baby die

She took it as a message from a real and a distant life  
  
Shirley gets to help her with the child though  
she's strung out on crack time  
Shirley never knew what it was to be held in real love  
Together getting high to get to mess up their night  
Anything to get up so they're losing their mind  
Just to get high, breaking out from this life, gotta get them a drug to get

Along the good king's highway  
My fortification took me by surprise  
And hit me sending me sideways  
Spellbound - Roundly - Good for sunshine  
Can't help thinking  
  
Singing the Rule Britannia  
And this is where it grabs you  
There's method in the key of see  
Toledo's got to be the silver city  
In this good country  
  
Our song  
It gives us a reason  
Our song  
That good remedy  
Music has magic  
That stuff of syncopation  
  
Ever tried driving it to golden heights  
Just simply jiving it  
My mystification it got a  
Jewel skies crazy spacing it  
Hot sun - Crowded - Screams high voices  
Singing speechless  
  
Touching of the healing heart  
So this is where we really start  
Music is a shout of foregone conclusions  
As long as music plays its part  
Good good part  
  
Our song  
It gives us a reason  
Our song  
That good remedy  
Music has magic  
It's good clear syncopation  
  
Treat it good  
Treat it rightly  
And if you get it flowing  
The harmony is glowing  
So get ready  
So get ready  
Don't go toledo toledo don't go  
Music

And the future is at hand  
I'll be calling voices of Africa  
Be the rhythm to the plan  
  
From the Congo to Lenasia  
Be the writing on the wall  
I'll be calling the colors of India  
See the Asian life explode

Head into the headlight  
Don't turn from the rain  
There's a fire raging somewhere near  
like a longtime friend who's  
Seen it darker than ebony  
Take off on the turnpike  
(Asking for the first call)  
Give me more of the same  
(Asking for a song)  
There's a fire burning in my heart again  
  
I'll be calling the dragons of China  
See the dancers of the Nile  
See the wings of change are on display  
This revelation mine  
  
Feel the calling of the miracle  
In the presence of the word  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Feel the calling of a miracle  
The revelation mine

Reminded of an inner pact between us  
That's seen as we go  
And ride there  
In motion  
To fields in debts of honor defending  
  
Stand the marchers soaring talons  
Peaceful lives will not deliver freedom  
Fighting we know,  
Destroy oppression  
The point to reaction  
As leaders look to you attacking  
  
Choose and renounce throwing chains to the floor  
Kill or be killing faster sins correct the flow  
Casting giant shadows off vast  
Penetrating force  
To alter via the war that seen  
As frictions spans the spirits' wrath ascending to redeem  
  
Wars that shout in screams of anguish  
Power spent passion bespoils our soul receiver  
Surely we know.  
In glory we rise to offer,  
Create our freedom, a word, we utter a word.  
  
Words cause our banner, victorious our day  
Will silence be promised as violence display  
The curse increased we fight the pow'are and live by it by day  
Our Gods awake in thunderous roars and guide  
The leader's hands in paths of glory to the cause  
  
Listen should we fight forever  
Knowing as we do know  
Fear destroys?  
Listen should we leave our children?  
Listen our lives stare in silence  
Help us now  
  
Listen your friends have been broken  
They tell us of your poison  
Now we know  
Kill them give them as they give us  
Slay them burn their children's laughter  
On to Hell  
  
The fist will run  
Grasp metal to gun  
The spirit sings in crashing tones we gain the battle drum  
Our cries will shrill the air will moan and crash into the dawn  
The pen won't stay the demon's wings, the hour approaches  
Pounding out the Devil's sermon  
  
Soon oh soon the light  
Pass within and soothe this endless night  
And wait here for you  
Our reason to be here  
  
Soon oh soon the time  
All we move to gain will reach and calm  
Our heart is open  
Our reason to be here  
  
Long ago, set into rhyme  
  
Soon oh soon the light  
Ours to shape for all time, ours the right  
The sun will lead us  
Our reason to be here  
  
Soon oh soon the light  
Ours to shape for all time, ours the right

Chased amid fusions of wonder  
In moments hardly seen forgotten,  
Coloured in pastures of chance  
Dancing leaves cast spells of  
Challenge,  
Amused but real in thought,  
We fled from the sea whole.  
Dawn of thought transferred through moments of days underseaarching  
Earth  
Revelaing corridors of time, provoking memories,  
Disjointed but with purpose,  
Craving penetrations offer links with the self-instructors sharp  
And tender love  
As we took to the air, a picture of distance.  
Dawn of our power we amuse redescending as fast as misused  
Expression,  
As only to teach love as to reveal passion chasing  
Late into corners,  
And we danced from the ocean.  
Dawn of love sent within us colours of awakening among the many  
Won't to follow,  
Only tunes of a different age.  
As the links span our endless caresses for the freedom of life  
Everlasting.

Lost in lights array

What happened to this song we once knew so well?  
Signed promise for moments caught within the spell  
I must have waited all my life for this  
Moment moment

The light we were as one  
And crowded through the curtains of liquid into sun  
  
And for a moment when our world had filled the skies  
Magic turned our eyes  
To feast on the treasure set for our strange device  
  
What happened to wonders we once knew so well?

Sheltered with our passion

Young christians see if from the beginning  
Old people feel it, that's what they're saying.  
Move over glory to sons of old fighters past.

She would dance and sing so completely.  
So be still he now cries  
I have time, oh let clay transform thee so.  
  
In the deep cold of night  
Winter calls, he cries ""Don't deny me!""  
For his lady, deep her illness.  
Time has caught her  
And will for all reasons take her.  
  
In the still light of dawn, she dies.

As I kiss your fingers.  
We walk hands in the sun.  
Memories when we're young.  
Love lingers so.  
  
Was it sun through the haze  
That made all your looks  
As warm as moonlight?  
As a pearl deep in your eyes,  
Tears have flown away,  
All the same light.

They called me mamma boy but now they call me drummer boy,  
They talking jet skiis, I had that shit last summer boy,  
Charles is gone, Cher is show case,  
5 5 9 night life (they had it goin on),  
Back then Shawty D was gone,  
Flat heat right here was on,  
They put me on the song back then we all got along, ain't had no switch game  
Atlanta just won't be the same,  
Hit Man, Sammy Sam, DJ Smurf and Ying Yang,  
I know when kids rockin(?) used to beat the block, I lived in a little house
boy,  
And the block party would never stop, I remember when G-Lyfe was when I had
that little jelly bean,  
I remember them East 30 Cadillacs and  
Cut Supreme,(?) I built the school and shot Marvin that's what I did,  
I remember the curfews what we used to get(?).  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A parking lot Alley niggaz thinkin' again,  
When you speaking bout' Atlanta mention Ying Yang Twins,  
There born and raised,  
God done made it hard for us,  
'Cause y'all outta towners came here and fucked shit up,  
But y'all can't fuck with us, cause as soon as shit start goin on you leave
Atlanta and go right back home,  
And that's the pussy mother fucker,  
Ya heard me motherfucker, bring off in there mouth (?) ATL-ANTA,  
Stop asking me cause that why I stay, if you can spell,  
That's Atlant motherfucker, ya heard me mother fucker,  
So don't ask me again,  
'Cause I ain't saying it again,  
Let me ask you do you remember jelly bean Cherri Show Case Club sense in tha
game,  
Lemme tell you about some ghettos,  
Inglewood East Lameadows(?) ATL.

They put ya way behind  
And they supports in minimum wage  
They don't give a choice to niggas  
They thinkin' we still slaves

Every niggas got a grudge in him  
Every niggas got a mug in him

We just black people gone and lost our mind  
We just really trying to draw the line  
Before it left our eyes  
Before we get left behind  
Let me tell you something about hard times  
Before we used to walk  
Before we had life in the dry  
And 911 wasn't known outside  
We didn't know how to read  
We didn't know how to write  
All we did was sing all day and all night  
Then when they let us start learning  
You all lose y'all mind  
And y'all forgot about the earlier times  
When Martin Luther King had a dream  
That one day we'd walk together  
We really need to get it together  
Kids stay in school  
Learn all you can  
Graduate, go to college, get knowledge  
Then we shall overcome, yes we can, we  
In the urge of faith we can demand it, for real

that's why they got the door  
More time, hoot hoot  
Aim aim, shoot shoot  
ain't nothing but the young kids they recruit  
Its a wonder they don't come home in they suit  
I took away some time  
Thinkin' how i could, should, would be  
If everybody in the world was free  
No crime nobody doing wrong  
Everybody getting along  
But when i step into reality  
This world is sore  
And that's why we at war  
Killin' ourselves over bullshit  
That we valued more than life

Fixing to put the heels on  
Chrome spokes with the low pros  
And the trunk funk blows up the cedar on the dashboard

This is the men's national anthem for this year  
All you real women,  
You all can sing this shit too  
If you a hoe and you hate another hoe,  
You can sing this shit too  
If you a bitch and you hate and bitch,

Ying Yang Twins,Live Again,/y/ying+yang+twins/live+again_20422863.html,"[Intro: D-Roc]  
I know what you go through  
From me to you, I love you  
  
[Verse 1: D-Roc]  
From the nigga to the baller, never satisfied  
So the money got you doing shit that'll fuck up your pride  
You ain't a hoe, you just really trying to get by  
Every day looking up at the sky  
Sometimes, shit get so hard  
It really have you bothered  
First you sigh, then you cry  
Up a whole puddle of water  
Seem like this shit won't ever end  
Merry go rounds to the whirlwinds  
Waves turn to a hurricane  
If you see joy, you got to see pain  
Shit in the world ain't gonna ever change  
Even when you die, it'll be the same  
Now you due to them circumstances  
Jars aren't counted so your forced to dance  
Hoping and praying for a second chance  
Just wanna put back on your pants  
Walk out the club and throw up your hands  
Tired of being disrespected by her man  
Think this shit ain't right for you  
Niggaz been yellin all night for you  
Got in your mind what's best for you  
Walk up to the club to tell them your through  
  
[Chorus: Adam Levine]  
She's stuck off in this little room  
With nothing left to hold onto  
Her life is in a little box  
She's wondering will it ever stop?  
The life of a stripper  
  
[Hook: Girl]  
I'm so sick and I'm so tired  
Of these clubs, I keep crying  
Every night, I wipe my eyes  
Cause these years pass me by  
I give up, I'm all in  
My whole life is full of sin  
This road is a dead end  
I wanna live again  
  
[D-Roc]  
From the part where a child is torn from a mothers umbilical cord  
No one really enforces that lifes gonna be hard  
Which is kinda left up to the teachers  
And the teachers leave it up to the preachers  
the preachers ain't fillin' up the bleachers  
It's the rappers  
Sad, ain't it  
  
[Verse 2: Kane]  
It was this girl named Star, pretty fine little woman  
Going to college, taking off her clothes for money  
She gotta pay the rent, she got a little girl  
Her baby daddy ain't shit, See what she dealin with?  
But she gotta hold on (hold on)  
Wanna leave the club alone (you dead wrong)  
She gotta pay the bills but in the meantime  
She like ""fuck how she feel"" living is real  
So she back in the club again  
Taking off her clothes again  
Going to school, going to work, getting tiring  
Lack of sleep but baby gotta eat  
and these shoes on her feet  
She got a test next week so she stressed  
Ask god to give her a blessing, send her in the right direction  
Her parents died when she was eight years old  
And after that, she felt like she was all alone  
But she got her grandparents and they raised her well  
Keep going to school, take care of yourself  
Getting hard, going to school and work in the club  
And at the same time looking for love  
She can't keep skipping for an occupation  
In a minute, she'll be graduating  
Make her wanna throw up her hands  
Now she only wanna live again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Hook]

Ying Yang Twins,Long Time,/y/ying+yang+twins/long+time_20422853.html,"Girl, Me and the Lods been friends for a mighty long time  
(such a mighty long time, such a mighty long time)  
And girl, the thought of leavin' you has never crossed my mind  
(Well oh oh..)  
  
Up in the street and misguided never payed attention  
So I got my soul devine, player's soul decided  
to let my soul confide with the lights of him  
Who the father, my bread and my water  
I never bought a cue and into this (?)  
Down in my world are you going let you hypocrites  
It'll take your life to be a Christian man  
I hope you learn, everything else  
Is in vein so you're bound to burn  
Gonna break your bone  
I'm in a war don't let this life game over-rule  
Trying take control of you  
That's all the devil do  
God was in Jesus, God is in us  
But God ain't in the barrel of that pistol that you bust  
You can play this game wrong, you gotta take it how it goes,  
Is there ever a feeling for living if the body's gone  
I never understood why what can make a man cry,  
It can make a man strong when nobody's on his side  
  
Girl, (girl) Me and the Lords been friends for a mighty long time  
(such a mighty long time, such a mighty long time)  
And girl, the thought of leavin' you has never crossed my mind  
(Never crossed my mind, never crossed my mind, oooh)  
(Well oh oh..)  
  
Back and forth, night and day, you repeat the same scene  
Standing at the pool a bit, time to repent again  
Mostly men have a gun just put that down on circle purpose  
When the poo of the world, got me standin by the circle  
Agitate you, yes it does, this is what you though was love  
Only name, same to be lust, mixed emotions make you want to bust  
Mamma tryin, children cryin, dad outta work, welfare lying  
Prejudice, always see, the bottom of the barrel  
Falling down on my knees, heavenly father, here we go on knowing  
That we get to heaven, there's gonna be some open arms,  
Judgment was man-made, not a [..], and this I recorded,  
But I didn't live the party, but I thank that my heart beat,  
Gotta make me, oh sure Jesus I don't know if there's a hell,  
But I know I've whitnessed hell here, all I do is dwell here  
Trying not to trail here, saying too much will get you knocked off or locked
up in jail here  
Tell me do you smell fear, knowing that we so near,  
Trying to take the voices of the truth, out the youth ear,  
And if you late a time frame, you play all kind of mind games,  
I ain't put my life on the line for a damn thing  
  
Girl, Me and the Lords been friends for a mighty long time  
(such a mighty long time, such a mighty long time)  
And Girl, (I don't really want to be without you) the thought of leavin' you
has never crossed my mind  
(Never crossed my mind)  
(Well oh oh..)  
  
I can never make it, I can never ever make it  
Without you baby  
Cause you've been my best friend  
Girl,  
When everybody turned their back on me,  
You were there when I fell down on my knees  
And I give you all, all of me,  
And every part of me, oooowoooo,  
  
Girl, me and the Lords been friends for a mighty long time  
(For long time, such a mighty long time)  
And girl, (I don't really want to be without you) the thought of leavin you
has never crossed my mind  
(Never crossed my mind)  
(Well oh oh..)  
  
I'm a live, I will never leave o no no  
When the people say, c'mon and go with me  
'Cause I will never leave you, and you've been my best friend  
nobody understand, but they can't look inside of me,

Ying Yang Twins,My Brother's Keeper,/y/ying+yang+twins/my+brothers+keeper_20422983.html,"[Chorus]  
They don't know how far back that we go (we go)  
From riding skates, to riding 24's  
From off the block hustlin' to rockin' shows  
We done seen many bumps in the road  
But still we remain, still in the game  
Never worry , about them haters, that will never change  
And I put this on everything babe  
I am my brother's keeper.  
  
Listen D-roc, I know you don't think I care for ya,  
But at a drop of a dime I'll be there for ya,  
And anybody want to see us apart we need to get rid of  
They ass man and that's from the heart.  
Pick em apart now that the ying yang twins got some ends,  
We seem to have plenty of friends. excuse me then friend,  
Let me borrow a stack and when tomorrow comes don't ask me to borrow it back.  
If they can't do that they don't contribute to the answer ? from the ?  
Serious as cancer. If I was jojo dancer I would do the same thang,  
Not to let another man spark my flame. D-roc is the ying,  
Kain is the yang but without  
The both of us we ain't got a damn thang.  
Its me and my brother, my brother and me, all that you see on TV  
  
[Chorus]  
  
United states of Atlanta its still me  
And my brother we done been through a lot but still kain I love ya.  
Blood, sweat, and tears, good days and bad from  
The time you make me laugh you made me mad.  
I still got cha back but imma take ya way back  
When we was sufferin just to get a nickle sack, scraping up  
Change trying to make 2 dollars or 3 to get  
Some 99 cent hamburgers to eat  
And then ride thorough atlanta in yo raggedy car.  
Back then we was some  
Underground superstars and these last 5 years we done put work in,  
Now the whole world know of the ying yang twins.  
Even though we don't spend time at home  
Together, we hit the road and its like we never left each other.  
Now that's love,  
I love you til the day that I leave so its still my brother and me.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
People of the world we must change our mind frame  
And stay away from the con and mind games.  
Its hard to maintain and stay sane at the same time, steady  
Working hard but you bareky gettin by trying  
To make a line between stress and peace  
And satan always gettin the best of me,  
My closest of kin, my best  
Friend, man we all in the struggle  
But you gotta remember I'm yo brother.  
Listen people you need to start helping yo brother,  
Helping yo sister, mama, daddy, children and all.  
Don't leave these babies out here all alone they  
Don't know what's going on. THey don't know right from wrong,  
So when you see yo brother give him a hug  
And a shoulder to lean on and don't leave him out here  
On his own cause times gettin hard these days.  
We at war amongest ourselves and we at war overseas brother.

When a women play the role of a man  
Talking to a nigga like you got to hold his hand  
Treat me like a sped, like he lack to understand

Tellin me you out with your friends  
Find out later on you with your other men  
You ain't nothing but a dividend  
Say you suck and fuck but you ain't gettin nothin  
That's a damn shame it ended like this  
And I ain't got love for you bitch  
Shoo fly don' bother me  
Will I get back with her probably  
Then I thought about it I won't  
Do I really want you I don't  
The headache I really don't want  
So I'm going to leave her alone  
Cause I can do bad on my own, that's why she gone  
Every now and then you get mad  
Sometime I make you sad  
Make you want to say kiss my ass

If you are rich, or if you are poor,  
There is no difference,  
It's still in what you're fighting for.  
If you are strong you will survive,  
You'll feel the fire,  
Burning on forever more.

Sticks and stones may break my bones.  
But your words, they never hit home.  
Time to say good-bye to all the pain.  
And chase away the rain.  
Now there is wind in my sails.  
And I cannot fail.  
Let the good times roll.  
Let the good times roll.  
I'm a soldier and I will fight.  
On through the darkness and into the light.  
Now the ace is up my sleeve.  
It's so good it's hard to believe.  
I will take the journey to the end.  
Until there is nothing left for you to defend.  
Now the tables are being turned.  
And it's time for you to burn.  
Now there is wind in my sails.  
And I cannot fail.  
Let the good times roll.  
Let the good times roll.

Back in Memphis Tenn with drank

45 get the nine and every dollar gone count

I ain't trying to please a nigga I'm trying to stack some ends  
The strong survive while the weak slowly dying

Sometimes I wonder why we have so much trouble  
Cheering each other up sometimes,  
When one or the other of us is down.  
Instead it's like, when you're in a bad mood

Beatle John Lennon lost his hospital bed yesterday to a patient  
It happened at Queen Charlotte's Hospital, London  
Where John was keeping vigil in the room  
Where his girlfriend, Yoko Ono

When he realized his bed was needed for an urgent case  
John sent out for a sleeping bag  
And last night  
He was once more happily kicked out alongside Yoko

Yoko who expects her baby next February

The Beatles win battle of the nude LP!  
The Beatles have won their fight to put out an LP record  
With a sleeve showing John Lennon and Yoko Ono in the nude!  
  
EMI, the world's biggest recording company  
Whose artists includes the Beatles  
Refused to handle the LP called 'Two Virgins'  
Because of the sleeve  
So did the group's American outlet, Capitol Records  
  
But the record with its controversial sleeve  
Will be released in both countries next month  
An official of The Beatles Apple company said last night  
The sleeve has not been censored or altered in any way

I just can't think of anything that could make me smile like you can  
When you're coming 'round the bend, noooo  
  
I've been in love a time or two before  
And all of that experience allows me to be sure  
That you're the one  
Sure as darkness brings the rising sun  
  
[ Chorus ]  
  
We both share the trials of the road  
Cursing all the miles and the nights we spend alone  
But then I smile  
You've been waiting for me all the while  
  
[ Chorus ]  
  
I know the sun could hide behind the clouds for days  
And I've walked down crowded streets and never seen a smiling face  
And times like those, I'll just close my eyes and picture when

Slipping outta my range  
Another night on a meat hook  
Just tryin' to pickle my brain  
Why the hell are you running  
And what are you standing for  
A lightweight with the baggage  
Slung out the door  
  
So roll us on up in shrink-wrap  
It sounds like a good place to hide  
'Cause heads an' tails it's a night on  
We'll be there 'til the end of the line  
  
I asked out the back  
To find a word in a cloud  
Told me something that I already knew  
Now if you're waiting for luck  
To come and touch you up  
You better wear yourself a good-lookin' suit  
Don't you come around asking  
'Cause I ain't got an answerin' mind  
I'm gonna get real damn familiar  
With something with ice  
  
So set us on up in the corner  
And throw over that bottle 'o wine  
'Cause heads and tails it's a night on  
We'll be there till the end of the line  
We'll be there till the end of the line  
We'll be there till the end of the line

Or trust in the way that it feels  
Chasin' up the coins into the ocean  
And choppin' up the carriages to fight the locomotion alright

A birthday in North Albany

and said with every prehistoric thought  
you can stain  
For every door that's been closed  
there's another of your friends you can dose  
While your brains seem to speak through your clothes  
And for every handshake that'll pay  
there's another motherfuck who'll complain  
that to keep a legal dose is so lame  
Are you stray?  
Those born with gold with weary souls  
Should eat their young and die

Nigga, murder, murder mayne

From neck down, I'm black down, eye to eye when I blast

His fuckin' knees, before we leave, we gon' locate them ki's  
A nigga gotta eat, ya heard me?  
You know the player when we get there, kill everything in there  
Leavin' no clues, like we never even been there  
Life ain't fair but fuck it, it's a new year  
I'm grabbin' my strap, cockin' it back and boo-yaa

No bullshittin', see they don't know just how we livin'

Make your own decision, it's gon' be a long ride  
I need the money, I can't wait a long time  
Keep a strong mind 'cause we done waited in a long line  
Just to get our shine on, now it's our time  
Believe that, it's our turn  
Pull out your weapon to burn, get what you earned  
We all must learn, that money is the key to life

Woke up screaming fuck the world today I, had it up to here  
Ex-girlfriend got custody today cause, they say she feels  
That I'll never be the daddy that she, wants me to be  
Hardest thing I've ever had to do, sayin' bye to my seeds, ohhh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Damn, look at what I call my life, a glock-9  
And a eightball of white, I got mine  
Well, not quite, I got signed  
And fifty put me right in the light, it took time  
Meanwhile I'm livin the life  
Where a nigga just might see prison tonight  
My rent due, baby need food and shoes  
I'm flat broke, still I refuse to lose  
So I smoke, lookin' for the fools with jewels  
I'm 'bout to see if it's true what a Uzi do  
Nobody cares, and life ain't fair or free  
The best thang you can do is say a prayer for me  
And how dare, y'all try to lock me up  
You not here, so you ain't really givin' a fuck  
But I swear, as long as I'm breathin', I'm hustlin'  
I'm thuggin', and this is the reason because I  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you see me in a suit and tie (in a suit and tie)  
Tell all my niggaz goodbye (tell my niggaz goodbye)  
Tell 'em that I'm on my wayyyyy (tell 'em I'm on my way man)  
Say a prayer for me and hug the kids (hug the kids)  
Tell God all of the shit I did (the shit I did)  
And how the kids looked up to me (cause they did look up to me nigga!)  
Yeahhhh  
  
Heyyy, holla if you feel my pain  
I been to hell and back, and I'm still the same  
The block hotter than flames, but we sell the 'caine  
Putti'n all kind of thangs in our baby's name  
Tell the hoes ""I'm rich bitch"" like my name Rick James  
I really ain't got shit, but I can't complain  
Cause L.T. got life, and Big Ju got fifty  
Jimmy did his ten and D doin his twenty  
Come get me, seems like it's no way out  
So when I say ""Dirty,"" you say ""South""  
Tryin' to put my hands on somethin', brush off my shoulders  
Buy up some land or somethin', get what they owe us  
You don't have a plan, you're nuttin' is what they told us  
Remember what the O.G.'s showed to the soldiers  
Gotta make it to heaven or die tryin' to get it  
The day dude fuck with Dre, I was feelin' like

24 hour shifts to keep this cocaine off of me  
Y'all ain't livin' how I'm livin', one mo' week I'm seein' prison  
'Cause to get what I'm after, a nigga might be missin'  
I ain't listenin' to shit, hit the Sweet and load the clip  
'Cause if crime didn't pay, then I'd be still on the strip  
You niggaz still runnin' yo' lips, I be runnin' them zips  
Up and down the interstate, makin' ten G's a trip  
A hardheaded nigga, do whatever it takes  
To go and get that bread nigga, heard what I said nigga?  
Been misled for a long time, waited in a long line  
Finally I'm here, now this rap game is mine  
Keep the herb burnin', ain't nuttin' changed 'cause I'm worth somethin'  
Y'all know the Young Buck, I'ma leave this earth bluntin'  
But still carry, the chrome Dirty Harry

E'rybody want the Presidents 'cause niggaz gotta eat  
So I try to leave no evidence and come when you sleep  
In your residence nigga until my mission's complete  
Stay draped in my heat, paranoid like that  
You kill me? R.I.P. I got boys like that  
Who said they needed a white pack to strike back, shit  
Just give me the right mac and nigga I'll be right back  
Hardcore, and show these niggaz they don't want war  
You want more? Well gimme what I'm here for  
Y'all know I been raw, from day one  
This teenager with the big boys, gettin' the job done  
Got a daddy, but he ignored both of his sons  
Had to pay for my own way, as a child on the run  
I ain't scary, the AK-47, I married  
'Cause a nigga had to have that by any means necessary  
Hey, I can't keep livin' this way  
'Bout to load up my fuckin' AK  
My mission is to go and get paid  
Get paid  
Hey, I can't keep livin' this way  
'Bout to load up my fuckin' AK  
My mission is to go and get paid  
Get paid  
Look what y'all done to me, forced a nigga to this point  
Wouldn't feed me when I was hungry, I couldn't ignore it  
But I stay to my lonely, and didn't show it  
So when I killed you and your homies, you wouldn't know it  
Cristal I let you po' it while I fuck with the Hennessey  
All this time I'm the nigga that you pretend to be  
Tables done turned now I'm like remember me?  
The same lil' nigga you overcharged for a ki  
Times hard on a G, you was larger than me  
Young, but I ain't dumb, you ain't smarter than me  
Give niggaz a inch, and they takin' the whole mile  
So I hop out the 6, and I takin' they whole pile  
Uh-uh whoa now, how many niggaz see this grown child  
Shit gettin' hectic then you shut 'em down  
Tennessee to Uptown, niggaz is thuggin', mean muggin'  
Ain't no stoppin' I'm hot, and the game is what I'm lovin' nigga  
Hey, I can't keep livin' this way  
'Bout to load up my fuckin' AK  
My mission is to go and get paid

All my nigga say  
Hey, I can't keep livin' this way  
'Bout to load up my fuckin' AK

So it's no time for me to beef with Jada, Joe or Game (Game)  
Diamonds in my chain (chain) a Chevy in my yard  
And a baby blue Phantom that I keep in the garage (uh-oh!)  
Come here, let me talk to you, show you what my grill 'bout  
Ice like Paul Wall but I can't take mine out (Yeahhh!)  
Let's play the game ""Big Bank Take Lil' Bank""  
Flood it like Katrina, make sure that your ship sank (damn!)  
You would think money's growin on trees  
The way your boy run through a couple hundred G's  
Fresh white tee 'bout to get my hustle on (yeah!)  
I ain't goin to the club, 'til all my work gone (C'MON!)  
I'm leanin on the leather, and grippin on the wood  
And I can build whatever, you know my money good, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
If can get money (money) I be in the hood (hood)  
I be stackin' paper like a real nigga should  
My money good, get money!! We ballin' in the hood  
Money good, get money!! We ballin' in the hood  
I be pimpin' hard (hard) and I got them hoes (hoes)  
You ain't gotta ask me, you already know  
My money good, get money!! We ballin' in the hod  
Money good, get money!! We ballin' in the hod  
  
I got my mind on my money (money) my money on my mind (mind)  
I'm good in the hood so you know I'm gon' shine  
Get you some, get you some, get you some, get you some  
Get you some, get you some, get you some, get you some (Yeahhhh!)  
I'm sellin' everythang (thang) and savin' every dime (dime)  
I'm good in the hood so you know I'm gon' shine  
Get you some, get you some, get you some, get you some  
Get you some, get you some, get you some, get you some (Yeahhhhh!)  
  
Fifty for the watch (watch) a hundred for the bracelet  
I'm headed to the top (top) I can damn near taste it  
I represent my block (block) and give away the ones (c'mon!)  
The hustle never stops so my job is never done (ayy!)  
So tell me what it costs (costs) and show me who the boss (boss)  
Put your money where your mouth is, I'ma break him off (break him off)  
If you wanna know the reason why I act like that  
I can fit a half a mil' in this Louie backpack, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Go and do your thang (thang) just don't get caught  
Let your money talk (Hey!) I let my money talk for me  
If shorty wanna hate, then tell the bitch to walk  
Let your money talk (Hey!) I let my money talk for me  
  
Call me what you want, but you can't call me broke (broke)  
Cause gettin' big bags of money's all we know (know)  
Marble floors in the projects, ghetto millionaire  
All this Gucci in my closet, I don't know what to wear (yeah!)  
Bentley outside by the ice cream truck (truck)  
Just ride through the hood, ask 'em if they seen Buck (Buck)  
Thought I wouldn't make it, but look at me now  
That's why I painted the Benz the same color as Cristal (Let's go!)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Get money!!  
Hey, get money!!  
Get money!!  
Hey, get money!!

I need some sleep, the fiends still comin'  
Bush 'bout to blow this bitch up  
Better get money, dead bodys get picked up  
I'm David in teen's now  
Niggas we're digital, but they work triple beams now  
I'm livin' for me now, 'cause I done went to war with the other side  
Lucky me, 'cause the enemies mother and brother died  
Hot shot gun shell's and teflon chest plate's  
It's tatt'ed on my arm nigga, thugin' till my death day  
Ya'll niggas just wait, right after my court date  
It's gonna get grimey, like new york say  
Bitch niggas horse play, real niggas gon' spray  
Bang the fo', change clothes, and come back the same day  
Better holla mayday, 'cause we comin'  
And we gunnin at any muthafucka want sumthin  
  
They say thou shall not steal, thou shall not kill  
But rub me the wrong way, nigga and I will

And even if I do die, I'm still gon' kill ya  
I'm unfamiliar with a lot of these soldiers  
I go out in the road, and niggas think that it's over  
Runnin, the fiends all puttin too much soda on the d'  
You would think niggas know, 'cause they older than me  
Been here longer than me, and still peace'n a ounce out  
How can ya' be a birdman, if you don't know how to count  
It's back to the black gloves, and home invasions  
Puttin holes in a nigga, the size of a gold dayton  
No I'm not waitin on nothin, no more  
Eather you pay me what you owe me, or I'm cuttin ya throat  
Nigga ya baby momma know me, go and ask the hoe  
How I done tied her ass up over a bag of dope  
I'll be glad to go to the pen over revenge  
I'm comin' out the same way, a nigga went in  
  
They say thou shall not steal, thou shall not kill  
But rub me the wrong way, nigga and I will  
Thou shall not cheat, thou shall not squeel

Nigga, G-Unit Nigga!!  
Dayum.. I neva knew dis rap shit  
Could have a nigga beefin' wit his own homebois, ya'know?  
Shit fucked up, but dis how it goes...  
[Verse]  
Came up (Yuh!), I did my thang  
Dis is so real I ain't sayin' no names (Nah!)  
Started wit' a dream like Martin Luther King  
'Till tha Fed's came sayin' my whole fuckin' team (Huh!)  
Switched my game up, started from tha bottom (Why?!)  
My Daughter on tha way I don't need these problems (Aiight)  
Find me a new job - I wanna rap  
So I got myself a new squad, got out tha trap  
Didn't have too many niggas ridin' wit' me then (Uh)  
But now everybody wanna ride in my Benz (Uhh!!)  
Dis one nigga dat I called a friend of mine  
He was really right there when I didn't have a dime (Yeahh!)  
But I stayed on tha grind, waited in tha line  
Thinkin' dat we'd both git rich in due time (Nigga!)  
My blessin' came and people started to listin  
It's G-Unit now so I put him in posission (Owh!)  
To ride wit' a nigga, and make his own bread  
Can't give him tha world but hayell, I did what I can  
He got a lil' man dat he called his artist (Yeah!)  
I took him right in like ""Damn, let's start dis."" (C'monn!)  
Brought him round 50 to show him what he got  
He looked at me quickly and said he was hot  
We was on our way, straight to tha top  
But my homeboi feel like his man need to drop (Uh ohh)  
His frustration kicks in, now here we go  
My homeboi feelin' like I owe a lil' mo'  
Meanwhile dis tha 1st week my album out (Okayye!)  
Shit my own damn mama didn't have a house (Phureal!)  
Stay focused tha way I post dis  
When tha lights on, you can see tha roaches (Uh huh)  
Shit got bad, my homeboi really got mad  
'Cause he started losin' everythang dat he had (Aahh!)  
Nobody to blame but who else, Guess who?  
He started sendin' threats sayin' what he gon' do (Whudd!!)  
Now I can't live around dis beef stuff (Nah)  
Dis ain't New York, my city ain't big enough  
So I'm lookin' fo' my homeboy wit' guns and shit (C'monn)  
Askin' The Lord how did it come to dis (Why?!)  
There he goes, right there with his toy souljas  
I'm all by myself, let's git dis ova  
Dogg down on the whole crowd, don't nobody move  
Where my homeboi at, what he say he gon' do? (Huh!)  
Outta nowhere, my homeboi show his face (Aye!)  
But one of his souljas pull a gun from his waist (Dayum!!)  
I started to shoot, but I looked in his eyes  
And then I realized dat he didn't wanned die  
So it's back to my homeboi, Wussup now?!  
He like ""Damn Buck, you really actin' fucked up now""  
I'm like ""Nawhh, niggas say you trynnah kill me.""  
Glock still out nobody gittin' near me (Unh uh)  
A car door opens, and who do I see?!  
My homeboi artist who was down wit' me  
He holla ""Put ya guns down, and put ya hands up"" (What?!)  
I wadn't thinkin' I just fucked ya man up  
Picked up my strap, hopped in my 'Lac truck (C'monn)  
Told my homeboi ""Ya mayn's an act up"" (Nigga!!)  
Weeks went by, and we got back cool  
First it's shame on 'em, then it's shame on you (You!)  
'Cause these same ol' dues dat I let back round (Okayye)  
Doin' all kinds'a shit behind my back now  
Wanna sleep wit' tha enemy to make some noise? (Aiight!)  
But dis how it go in tha streets, when you war witcha homeboi  
[Outro]  
They smilin' in ya face  
All tha time they wanna take ya place (Backstabbas.. Backstabbas..)  
They smilin' in ya face  
All tha time they wanna take ya place (Backstabbas.. Backstabbas..)

They was glad I was broke, mad 'cause I'm rich  
So put that nigga out if it's a hater in this bitch (uh-oh!!)  
Stuntin in the club, make 'em start a riot  
Throw my hood up then go take it outside  
[Repeat]  
[Verse 1: Young Buck]  
Why you hate me nigga? Yo baby momma love me  
She see me in the club, and runs up and hug me  
I show her no love, she keep on comin back  
Tellin me she got yo club, and where yo money at  
It must be my 'Lac, that's sittin on Pirellis  
The way I count stacks, that's got these niggas jealous  
See I'm hard on a hoe, I get down for mine  
You need a hand-out bitch, don't waste ya time  
If you don't work (you don't work), you don't eat (you don't eat)  
We go to jail, go to church, go to sleep  
I'm ridin' 'round wit Scrappy in the A wit my heat  
Tryna figure out how to get to Peachtree  
Come on nigga  
[Verse 2: Lil' Murder]  
Young nigga, but a certified playa  
But youse a bitch nigga, youse a bonafide hater  
They was glad I was broke, but now I'm livin major  
Hustlin and servin niggas like a waiter for the paper  
We ridin down the strip in sumthin so wet  
When ya bitch see a nigga, wanna suck a nigga dick  
Smokin' dro and drinkin' liquor till a nigga get sick  
Every city, every state, it's the same ol' shit  
Nigga money make the world go 'round so get ya hustle on  
These niggas snitchin' so much, I'm like ""fuck a phone""  
Mad 'cause I'm on, they love to see me down  
I know you gon' let me shine and get mine  
Nigga  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 3: All-Star]  
Look, hatin' ain't healthy, nigga so keep it movin'  
These shots will wake ya whole hood up, I'm sleepin' through it  
Chea, I'm used to it, I done made a gun fire  
Pull the trigger one time, sound like a gun fight  
You was glad I was broke, now ya mad 'cause ya hoe  
Love it when a nigga put it in the back of her throat  
Buck, Hi-see, Murder, and Star, we ain't never scared  
I don't need my pistol in the club, I'll brawl there  
I know hustlers that do deal white  
Jump stupid, find out what these boots feel like  
Yea, y'all know me, All-Star I'm so street (yea)  
What it is, what it ain't, what it gon be  
[Verse 4: Hi-C]  
I don't bust my gun, like a halftime football game  
I aimed straight and I took y'all name  
And ya whole click look all lame  
You can catch me in the house with a pyrex and it cook all caine  
Put that metal in ya mouth, you gon swear I was doctor walls  
I'm in the club with my muthafuckin' glock in drawers  
I had to let my nuts hang, so I dropped my balls  
You ain't hit him wit no bullets nigga shot the walls  
You shoot to scare, I aim and kill  
When I dump on you, they gon think yo brain ain't real  
I'm heavyweight in the game, you featherweight  
When they hear a nigga take a loss, they wanna celebrate  
Bitch

Definitely lot of losers, snatching bro'd n used up  
Show her how to blow on my glass, eighty cash  
Eighty pecks of decks, and tha classical eighty jazz  
Eighty bags of money, eighty macks from royne  
A.K.A. they turning beef to eighty packs of bologne  
They waited on me, telling when its my time to cool it  
Blue chevey sit tall, like a colorado moose do  
My cookies drown like moons too, my regal look like prune juice  
Why should I be bishop, I'm drizzled, I got my own juice  
Own crew, own 26s on my own coop  
Own crib, own bricks, plus I own a couple chicks  
Know how to put bitches on they own, let her suck a dick  
Hey one when one look biggin, they gotta be licking pussy  
Money push it, bitch we got a avalanch block  
With mo cocain then they can pull off of tha dock  
Cut em off, viro ain't bitches ain't a thang  
In tha chair with tha brains gettin brains, diamonds on my chain

Stack of 20-dollar bill two bands in the middle

We don't talk on the phone 'cause it might stick  
Gotta play for the 7 call it Mike Vick  
Dirty birds nigger we play wit them falcons

Talking young hungry niggers eat ya whole plate  
Jeezy place the order niggers eat ya whole face  
You got me Mr. Scrooge all fucked up  
Jump out hit the switch light ya ass up  
  
Carbon 15 wit the one pound drum

My chain for yo life we can swap it out  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The hoes love my voice  
Make they pussy moist  
Certified g shit and I'm the gangster's choice  
Niggers popping off hope they bullet proof  
  
Leave holes inside ya like a sunroof  
Mack 11 in the club and a sub nose  
Swear to God knock you niggers out ya clothes  
Lay ya ass flat like a doormat  
  
Niggers ask for but they don't want that  
In the rap game takin' niggers clientele  
White ones like the powder that I used to sell  
Give a fuck about a player hater  
Hit 'em wit the tool bust his whole radiator

How much money would it take to make some mo money  
Damn right a nigga straight come get some mo from me  
I sold millions made them millions  
But still yaw doubt me what's this with out me  
Can't be that bad still got my trap swag  
And every time I do a show I leave with a trap bag  
Money in trash bags

It looks like garbage  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I get allot of that allot of this  
I need allot of it  
Sit on my bedroom floor counting all of it  
That money be Ludacris  
It just might shock you  
If you can't find Chaka then my right hands keep it  
Look I am simply on of the best  
Can't even lie i can't vouch for the depressed  
Just like zip-lock they get killed in the plastic  
Best add five grams so you can weigh it in plastic  
I am so dirty they wrap me in plastic  
When they wrap me in plastic need to put me in traffic  
They say that I'm difficult even different  
Show me the difference I'll bring you the difference

From the bottom to the top, that's a nice dream  
How you make it out young? I had a nice scheme  
And I don't owe a nigga shit, better get it right

I got the money and the fame and that don't mean shit  
I got the Jesus on a chain, man that don't mean shit  
Cause when the Jesus pieces can't bring me peace  
Sure I need just at least one of Russell's nieces on

You got that big fame homie, and you just changed on me

You told me kindly not to bring the white in your house

Bricks in the addict and yean know

Feds at the door I'm out of town  
Yean tell 'em shit, you held me down  
Now a-days I rock the mic I'm getting paid for that

Young Jeezy,The Inspiration (Follow Me),/y/young+jeezy/the+inspiration+follow+me_20695738.html,"Whats up?  
Ha ha  
Yeah! Yes! It's real talk, can I talk to y'all for a minute?  
I was in the streets the other day,  
I had a homie come through and he ask me  
Say ""Yo! Everybody listen to you,  
Everybody all ears, what you gonna do to give back?""  
I told him ""Look homie, I'm ten steps ahead of you, if not thirty""  
Real talk, listen up, I got one song, let's make it right, let's go  
  
I'm high on life and a fifth of Remy  
From the city where them young niggas die skinny  
Keep work on deck if you need any  
Just holler at them boys cause they keep plenty, follow me!  
Got the weight of the world on my shoulders  
And I swear it feels like ten thousand boulders  
And it's so heavy, but I'm so ready  
Feels like I was born for this  
If not, at least I'll die for it  
They said I couldn't do it but I'll still try for it  
The big question is what can I do for the youth?  
Everybody lyin to 'em so I told 'em the truth  
  
[Chorus]  
""I'm a hustler!"" So, one man, one stage, one mic  
One song, one chance to get it right  
I really thank y'all, we gon' see the night  
And I think I know the way, follow me  
""I got hustle!"" One man, one stage, one mic  
One song, one chance to get it right  
I really thank y'all, we gon' see the night  
And I think I know the way, follow me  
""I'm a hustler!""  
  
Real niggas don't die, they go to the Feds  
Fresh out, right back chasin' bread  
My life's so hard, so concrete  
I was raised by 'em homie, that's why I think so street  
Take me for instance  
My life is not about you, think me for instance  
I did the impossible, I made it out  
Got dealt a bad hand but I played it out  
I'm a left lane nigga, my life's so fast  
Now I'm thinking holmes, got my right blinker on  
Spread my word, got my Kirk Franklin on  
Stuntin' in traffic like ""This my car""  
Sometimes I wonder how I made it this far  
Life's a bitch so I'm tryna wife her  
Just ball around, you know, buy her some things  
Lovin' every minute of it, still breakin' chains  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Y'all my brush, let me paint a perfect picture  
Gotta pay attention cause it's three dimensional  
Same picture, see it one of three ways  
Let it marinate, it might take a few days  
They say all I talk about is drugs and violence  
So I shouldn't say nothin' Get a moment of silence  
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense  
Words to live by, took it out of context  
They say your pass is your present and your present is your cash  
So I look forward to the future  
Get a lil' paper your baby momma won't have  
Part of the college so I need a forecast  
Where's the weatherman at when you need him?  
A hungry nigga eat anything you feed him  
A rich nigga will buy anything you sell him  
And a broke nigga believe anything you fuckin' tell him

I'm blowin' good yeah I smoke it by the song,

Niggas acting like broads make me pick up my tone,

Yeah this one's for you fuck niggas, fuck niggas  
Yeah I'm talkin' bout them fuck niggas, fuck niggas

Hit the highway with the change, yeah the change man  
I dun it my way with them thangs, changed the game plan  
Had these niggas tellin' lies, they just sound true  
Nigga if you had it like that I would've found you  
I'm tryna cash out a hundred let me get a buck  
Bitch they'll be just like you nigga fake as fuck  
Get em home and they probably all sheet rock  
They sellin' bullshit fuckin' up the street stock  
You living mine and yours thats a double dip  
That synthetic ass shit we call it double whip  
And nigga nothing beat the cross but the double cross  
I ran the streets and rap bitch I'mma double boss  
Them niggas cashed out one I sent a double off  
They knocked him off halfway I took a double loss  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let's put these niggas on the stand, now stand up and be a man  
Raise your hand and swear you weren't my number one fan  
And I'm still that same nigga, you still that same nigga  
But at the same time, I'm starting to get bad vibes  
What I owe you sumthin' nigga, that's what you act like  
I ain't like them other niggas boy, you betta act right  
The first few years of your deal ride your training wheels  
And then you graduate and live how real niggas live  
And I ain't dissin', naw, I ain't dissin'  
But when you sit back and listen, this what the rap game's is missin'  
I'm used to thug niggas, it's too many young niggas with.  
Too much of liquor, too many drugs in em, too many clicks, too much swag
nigga,  
Too many niggas wearing tight shirts and skinnies, walking round with they ass
out  
Y'all betta cash out, gon' put your cash up  
Because I'm all in and if I don't win nigga, I'mma mask up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hardest part of life niggas cant play they role  
Everybody wanna ride the train, don't wanna pay the toll  
Keep it going young, boy you on a role  
Hoe nigga magazine, you the centerfold  
You can check the resume, nigga I'm good as gold  
Lawn chair ass niggas all they do is fold  
Nigga you talkin' with emotions, you emotional  
You might can get a lil' light, feelin promotional  
Tell me what cha see when you lookin' in the mirror  
Look as this hoe as nigga, I couldn't said it clearer  
And you the same nigga that started up this jewelry game  
And when you see him nowadays the nigga jewelry lame  
Ain't got it by now, nigga you ain't got it  
And why you talkin' like that cause bitch you ain't bout it  
And nigga how ya doin' now, worst then before  
And bitch we winning over here, I've been keeping score.

'cause' first it's me, and then it's you  
I say first it's me, and then it's you

Now over the years as a Youngblood, I done walked out and fought  
There's a cost to being brought up, and still I ain't gave a fuck  
Not easier said than done, it don't matter how many come  
They got you on the lock, striking men into your bums  
Sometimes I had no fun, now the law done got me trapped  
With my back against the wall, some waiting on me to turn it back  
Now that is that, and this is this, and if you miss, you bound to slip  
So watch that shit, just as they ship you, and pimp you, and dick you  
Takin' you for granted, so nigga you'd besta handle it  
Before they catch you slanted, don't panic, you on your own  
Now brace yourself, they everywhere off in your town, taking what is left

These drawls had me gone, Victorias and perfume  
See when it too much good, somethin' got to go bad  
Just yesterday got my insurance and tag  
Feelin' good never bad, on the way to see flat'  
Tryin' to take it to the crib tell my folks bout the zag  
Now see I'm in the Lac' so I ain't drivin' too fast  
Just my luck, I creeps up on they ass  
The police study beats, settin' up this road block  
Found out the hard way it's only 10 o'clock  
And ain't no room to shake the spot, plus everything tight  
Gave em' all my shit, pulled over to the right  
And what was said in my head ""Now I'm all fucked up""  
Like my square, sir tell me what is all this for  
I ain't did a damn thang, but I'm back in this wagon  
Handcuffin' this clown ass nigga still braggin'  
Ain't a damn thang funny, what the hell this be bout'  
Tell me where the fuck I'm going, how the hell I get out  
See at times like this, you gotta depend on your folk  
See we got that lil' bit, but rather spend it on dope  
Now I'm out this bitch, see your ass in court  
6 to 14 in 12, your too slow  
Hey what's up man, hey let me get one of them squares from you folk  
I hope these niggas at the house man  
Damn man ,these folk got me down here  
Bout' some motherfuckin' driver's license man  
What kinda shit is that man?  
Made my hoe walk to the house  
Man I hope these niggas at the crib man  
I gotta get the hell up outta here now  
That's on the blow  
Man these niggas ain't at the attic man  
Man, fuck this shit, man  
I gotta call my momma, man fuck this  
Bologna slab was thick, ain't no grits in my bowl  
Tryin' to take it to the crib, and sit on my commode  
They took my license, so now my shit is gone  
But me and this Cadillac, we got a mind of our own  
Wood grain, hill daddy tight  
Ready to stomp the gas when I see a flashin' blue light  
The reason that we ride like this, ain't got the funds to get the right  
Police be takin' out your ass, cash low  
Ain't got no place to stash my dope, at the time  
Either yours or mine, stay down on da' grind  
Servin' niggas with the dope from a blunt to a line  
Throw my shit in the bushes make it hard to find  
It's 6 to 14 and I ain't fuckin' around

I can't help but just to be that nigga, the nigga you can't fuck wit'  
Now what the hell, just done happened, as I'm lost in this shit  
Off in these cuts, doing what I gotta do, just as I reap bail  
And break bail, up out these jail cells, see what I do well

So I now I take it you the big dog about the south  
Oh really now, though whose to say that we won't never make it  
Or even get the chance to tell the world just how we made it  
Cause know that we gonna keep it crunk, no matter what  
Now who the fuck, just al nut, it's a must for you to get crushed  
So don't rush to get dat' change  
You'd besta wake on up and take a look inside this frame  
For everything ain't everything when times are gettin' rough  
To pressure is your conscience in this game you callin' bluff  
Now nigga what, yeah  
Oh, a lot of hatin' went on doing this thang here  
Folks just swore we wasn't finna' put it down for the A-town  
You know what I'm saying? I ain't gotta call no names  
Cause you know who you are  
You know what I'm sayin'  
All I got to say to all of y'all is...  
You can't keep nobody from the Attic down  
Know what I'm sayin', and that's on the floor  
Yea, it's me, remember me from back in the day  
The same ol' nigga you thought wouldn't get paid  
Look at me now nigga, shit done changed  
Ain't no mo' gettin' wet in the rain  
Hennessey and dank to kill all my pain  
Sho' nuff' you can hear, but you can't feel me man  
And it's a damn shame, we go through what we do  
Playa hatin' while I'm chillin' on the avenue  
Can't hold no nigga down from the Attic Crew  
that's for trill on the blow, straight from me to you  
Better listen up now, cause ain't no tellin' what's next  
The dem' between real and the ones that flex  
All in your face grinnin' when you cash that check  
But when they get down and dirty it's like ""fuck dat' bitch""  
Ass nigga, so how you figga' I was wrong  
Got a baby, and a crib to keep clothes on  
Long time ago, way before the grind  
Trouble had become a friend of mine  
You off up in my head, its just a matter of time  
Before I rip shit apart and let Sean Paul shine  
Like dem' folks open face off in yo' grill  
I ain't tryin' to be greedy, I'm just tryin' to live  
Now that the picture clear, and you know what I mean  
Being broke all again slick it's just a dream

And a time so pure, at least it seems  
A simple life, a modest one  
Where money plays a minor role  
And I pray and I'll try to keep this spirit inside me  
As I start to grow old  
This is an era of creativity  
Good music and good friends  
And the dreams that we reach for  
Seem to be at the tips of our hands  
And it's getting too late to appreciate  
And it soon will be the past  
But I'll still have these memories  
But why can't they fucking last  
Maybe they can  
This is a time, this is a time we'll remember  
This is a time with lots of hope  
And very little fear  
And a time where every move we make seems so sincere  
But when the song is sung and the moment's gone  
Only you'll know all we've shared  
And I hope that you can rekindle too  
This same feeling in the air  
This is a time we can remember

Waving your flag, we're number one

Too ignorant too see through their subtle attack  
To make us content but we must fight back  
You don't love your country  
You just love yourself

Like everyone else  
If your fights for freedom  
Then do what's right  
Put down that flag, protest and come join the fight

Be who you want, but be for real!  
Voice your opinion,

Speak your mind at your free will

Abusing, misusing you're out of control  
Your mind, spirit and body will take their toll  
A slave to your senses, I see nothing more  
Cause temporary pleasure is what you strive for  
Taken what you've wanted, stepped on what's in your way  
But there will be a price that you'll have to pay  
Easy acquaintances, broken friends  
Happy now but the loser in the end  
Broken promises, broken hearts  
Walk away when the pain starts  
You take what's yours you still want more

Progress is so sweet, ain't tripping with envy  
Slip and slide like a snake, pop up the world like a quake  
Mashing hard on the gas, with the coast on the plate  
  
Roll on cowards and busters, peeping them soldiers and hustlers  
Got an eye for them fuckers that trying P.H. with snorkels  
Got a trunk full of clutches, blinding mine make you stutter  
I blow like a hurricane, so close all your shutters  
  
See I wants everything and everything I'm gone have  
Roll out my red carpet just to go to my stash

From lane to lane we grip the grain and 20's chop up the curb  
We popping flippers on sippers, hey those g's on the rise  
With bubble eyes and customized and chrome twenty inches wide

Button rims they grip up, the talkers mouths gone zip up  
It's that time and here we come, third coast take a stand  
We drew it up and screwed them up and see went through with the  
  
Plan  
Jumped in the mix with hundred bricks and now a mobbing gorilla  
You had to miss go get her, about the scrilla my nigga  
Stay loaded up and we ready, Box City working that jelly  
  
Burning more streets than pereddy, while cutting up like  
Machetes  
No doubt screwed up candy paint, killer think straight drink  
  
Down here we swinging the tank, and every thought be bout bank  
I'm a be T from the S.U.C. pay dues got stripes that be ranks

No more signing dotted lines and I stay dollars spend  
I want convertible benz, with the blue bubble lens  
I'm worth a million off the corner when I'm pimping my pen  
  
See bubble gray is my choice, pearl white Rolls Royce  
Don't need no natural lemon tea I don't be training my voice  
I'm signed over by nature, suckers, punchers, simps and fakers  
A click full of back breakers and more in a Studebaker  
  
The Mo City don, I wave a truck like it's a warrant  
Hit the ATM machine, ain't no need for me to pawn  
'Cause I'm paid, my game sharper than a razor blade  
Bald faded and X-rated, my Gucci's is tailor made  
  
I bubble in the sauna as I smoke marijuana  
From Daytona to Arizona no longer on the corner  
World wide, I got to keep the dream alive  
Tupac and Biggie done died, so now they ready for the south side  
  
Top, dropping, body rocking the Fat Pat  
Dirty rats get splat when I pull out my black mac  
'Cause it's over, the fat lady done sung the song  
From California to Rome, these hoes pussies stay warm  
  
And on to the Alamo Dome, then right back home  
Ain't no regular we hydro as 4 54  
On the boards, be spinning flipping with yellow boned women  
Swimming in dividends cause I'm cold when I'm pimping

It's like tears doesn't matter to you, it's like you laughed at my pain  
Put me in a position to pick up a pistol, and I'll blast in the game  
I'm going crazy, being murdered by the hands of cancer  
Auntie asked if I wanted to die, but couldn't understand my answer  
See it's fucked up when you loving, they don't love you in return  
Fuck around and wait till you get on your feet, and slug you till it burn  
Niggas is flies yeah they over rise, but I hide in the dark  
Cause where the fuck was these niggas at, when I resided in parks  
Bitch I slept on the bench, ten feet away from the bullet proof fence  
But at least, I ain't have to pay no rent  
I'm thinking of espree, damn near positive that you regret me  
But I pray to God, you'll never forget me, remember me  
I represented for the both of us, how could you love me  
And not trust me, somewhere hated now there's no more us plus  
Sammy Lee it was a tragedy, your boo was found dead  
Here's my shoulder for you my nigga, rest your head  
  
[Chorus - 2x]  
This is where they all fall down  
Putting burners to they brain, till it bang  
There's no way for the real, to maintain  
This is where they all fall down  
Pay your dues, cause you owe  
When it's your time, God'll give you the go  
  
[Den Den]  
I sit back and put my thoughts, on paper and rhymes  
Tripping on the situations, that I'm facing in life  
All this shifeness around me, but I still prevail  
Get caught some shit we done together, and I'm making your bail  
Cut your tail, while you fall down homie  
Plus I'm in the kitchen cooking, so your family won't come hold me  
Fuck that phony shit, that these fake niggas on  
I get that pony bitch, then I get that hustle on  
Staying strong like ammonia, as I bleed the block  
Leaving that bitch swollen up, like I beat the cops  
Going rock for rock, breaking down every zone  
95 hundred woofing, where these niggas be strong  
Staying alone to my own, with my baby and wife  
Plus I'm keeping the bread a nine, cause I'm guarding my life  
Ain't no slipping in my game, doing a dance to make it rain  
Put a pistol to your head, and ease your pain  
  
[Chorus - 2x]  
  
[Z-Ro]  
I feel like I invented pain, might go any minute mayn, starting a bit of  
robbery  
Homicide and lean on they destiny, in an attempt to get the pain  
Constant strain, here we go again another day in the life  
If I'm blessed, can I just get one successful day in my life  
My life is the prime example, of a good nigga gon wrong  
And I trust no one plus I'm not friendly, so leave me alone  
See I don't need a click of yes men, when I walk the block  
My retaliation is only, when I chalk the block  
I stay in a sweet leaf, each time I meditate on how to live  
Nothing but negative everywhere I turn, ain't no more positive  
Nothing but drama, cause drama makes the world go round  
But pretty soon, it'll make the world go down  
Just get a weapon of situation, if you starving then you hungry right now  
I can't wait a whole pay period, I need money right now  
So when I bleed the block I'm not gon bleed a lot, just enough to keep  
The bills paid, and enough to keep some fiddles in a pot

One of my partnas have been shot  
And all that's going through my mind  
Is he dead or alive, when I'm pacing the flo'  
And looking around 4-5  
Thinking of the worst, but nobody would tell me the drama  
But the silence is killing me, checking on his family  
Saying a prayer for him and his mama  
Come through sit at his bedside, and ease his pain  
Relieve my tension, I'm flinching when they mention name  
Big D, come G, I don't want you to die  
Remember when we use to dip  
In your day-day Coupe and get high  
Remember, when you use to think I was crazy and wouldn't chill with me  
You come to get me up the flip, and smoke some kill with me  
I really appreciate the love that was shown  
I'ma keep the faith and never leave you alone  
You can depend on me, got down on my knees  
And I prayed, until you recovered  
Then jumped your big ass, right back off in the game  
Because there's money to be made, and I won't knock you  
Just watch yourself when you in them streets  
And keep your heater, under your seat when you creep  
[Hook - 4x]  
And to my G's  
Don't worry bout a damn thang  
[Z-Ro]  
You use to call me G.I., but to me you was s soldier indeed  
Even though you dodged the cops daily, you would hit my crib up with weed  
Freestyling to beats, and smoking on fire sweet and parlay  
You should of got a purple heart, for living in a war everyday  
If he's really a friend, you would turn him in  
That's what the laws would tell us  
And fellas would talk about turning you in  
How could your hood be so jealous  
And ready to give out the location, of a G on the move  
Somebody tell me, is your partna's freedom worth some money to you  
But I know he's in the county jail stressed, fuck stabbing you in your back  
Cause they smile up in your face, and stab you in your chest  
And its kinda hard, to receive the swishas they pass me  
When I feel I got to watch the people, they call his still family  
Must a song be coming, cause it happened the way you said it would unfold  
My name is Grady, and they watch me like the Super Bowl  
Now that your not around, I'ma still put it down the way you told me to do  
And when I go gold its dedicated to you, and to my G's  
[Hook - 4x]  
[Verse 3]  
I'm still trying to figure out what happened  
One minute you here, then the next you was gone  
Just think quick, I lost my nigga  
Victimized to the game, and we still mourn  
But nigga hold on, cause I know its living life  
Trapped in this cell, trying to ease the pain  
But it still remains, every time I put you in jail  
And its hard to accept the fact, that you a cellmate my nigga  
Po' out some liquor, and sho' wish was here to light, up this swisha  
And I'll never forget the advice you gave me bout life, cause you were right  
Don't shake them dikes, cause the rules apply, ain't always precise  
I'm paying a price, my freedom been taken away  
And they threw away the key, trapped in misery  
Cause suffering forced me to run these streets so desperately  
And to my G's watch your back, cause it ain't no love in these streets  
It seems like each day, there's a different way, to fall victim to defeat  
Cause if you real with your boy, it don't hurt to see him fall off  
When a forty get low point to the curb, just letting you know you thought of  
No matter what when you get out, thangs'll still be the same  
But until then hold on nigga, and don't worry bout a damn thang  
[Hook - 4x]  
[Z-Ro]  
This world is not my home, I'm just a passing through  
My treasures are laid out, somewhere beyond the blue  
The angels beckon me, from Heaven's open doors  
And a nigga can't feel at home in the this world no mo'  
Feel at home in this world no mo'

Make a nigga want to blow the badge, off of ya  
We been living hard, so it won't be soft for ya  
Fiending to see your blood, until you cough it up  
Mr. officer, crooked officer  
We just trying to feed, our sons and daughters sir  
We been struggling to make it, in America too long  
All we want to do is live our life, and be left alone  
[Z-Ro]  
Illegal search 45 minutes, what the fuck you looking for  
I roll on 24's, so the Dopeman is what they get me for  
And that's a shame, a nigga can't ride nice  
Without getting harassed, and facing 25 to life  
I wish I could make a citizen's arrest  
Knock the busters in the hole, and blow the badges up off of they chest  
Controlled substance on the ground, and it just had to be mine  
Fucking with me about weed, and they look blacker than mine  
Six months for getting caught up, with a soldier strap  
They'll put the felonies on me, but keep your doja sack  
That's why they proud to be, an American  
What about my Negro people, look how they stare at them  
With evil eyes, they hang a brother daily G  
The Judicial system, is our modern day slavery  
We ain't picking cotton no' mo' bitch, we picking off cops  
Negro life in association, we issuing out glocks  
[Hook]  
[Z-Ro]  
I put my hands up too slow, and I got shot in the back  
Thrown in the back of the paddy wagon, left to ride in the pack  
What about my medical condition, it's some bullshit  
We don't give a damn if you die, one less nigger to deal with  
Ask me why, I don't give a fuck about the police  
Cause all they offer is the penitentiary, with no peace  
They planting dope on niggaz, just to get a commission  
And if we don't cooperate, it'll be a longer stay in prison  
Everytime I had a flat, they'd just pass me by  
And if I was laying on the ground, they'd never ask me why  
But when I'm looking great, and rolling in something they can't pronounce  
They looking for any reason, not to let a nigga bounce  
Whether expired registration, or inspection stickers  
The only thing be on they mind, is we gon get them niggaz  
And it don't matter if we working, on a 9-to-5  
We rerouted by the system, facing 99

And pay dues

Extra extra read all about it, I'm going crazy  
Ro raging with motherfuckers smoking, going eighty  
Miles per hour, pass up the city gel on my collar  
Trying to locate and half of it, that will give a nigga some power  
Not saying that I'm weak, bullets gon hang when I speak  
I bust a brain if I reach, and get that thang off my seat  
I'm in love with selling, that's why I ain't winning that much  
Gas money looking funny, wheels ain't spinning that much  
But I'ma make it the way of the other, cause I can't stop  
People trying to trick me of my mission, but I can't drop  
Cause I can't fall, run up I'ma keep bumping my lead  
Before the game over I know, I'ma be dumping my lead  
Because I'm nervous by nature, the slightest move will get you shot  
I've been known to help niggas make it, to they burial plot  
Not my lifestyle, I love the way the feddy stack  
Record labels stealing Z-Ro, to CEO gon get it back  
[Hook]

Sometimes, I feel like doing myself  
Sixty percent of my body is drank, I ruin myself  
But I'm addicted, eyes fucked leaning and look inflicted  
With my facing revelations, tripping on what it predicted  
Cause it's happening, when the trumpet blow  
Ain't gon be no mo' laughing and, it's to the left or the right  
I hope I get to go to heaven, I hear heaven is tight  
Plus they tell me that hell is hot, and they won't give you no ice  
I need a cool wrist, most of these bitches be the devil trying to fool me  
Taking my kindness for weakness, and trying to use me  
Bitch fuck your hair and your nails, you bout to lose me  
I sleep with my uzi, cause she ain't gon steal from me if I nod off  
The only place I don't let her go, is in God house  
I'm a gangsta fa sho, you better believe me  
I bet I'll be on that doja, every time you see me  
[Hook]  
[Z-Ro]  
I done made up my mind  
Hustle all alone, I'm trying to get up some mo' shine  
Every time I turn around, someone bringing me down  
Got tired of em pulling on me, started slanging them rounds  
And now they thinking I'm a crazy  
Scarred and stabbed and shot, I'm still a baby, I want my mama  
Cause I'm having bad dreams, and I die in em all  
Got me ain't friendly when you see me, ain't no smiling at all  
I live the thug life, heartless and hopeless  
Laying low ducking the law, with long you lusting and acting douches  
I'm connected, my best friend use to be I-10  
Until my out of town connect, put out your chest and took my ends  
Got me throwed off in the mind, retaliation's what I take  
Fears get blowed off with my nine, incarceration's what I face  
Feel me, I done lost my mind, but it's all gravy baby  
I get tipped for knocking bustas off daily

But motherfuckers keep fuckin' with me doe mayne  
  
In case you don't know my name, I'm 'bout to tell you my name  
Z-Ro the crooked, 'King of Da Ghetto' all about my change  
I remember when Joseph wasn't able to have thangs  
Now I'm able to flip a 300-M and grab grain  
There's some niggaz mad at me 'cause I got cash mayne  
I'm the future of rap-a-lot, quit livin' in the past mayne  
Remember flippin' with a brick, in the dash mayne  
Now every time I roll up bitch give me bomb-ass brain  
  
Probably be somebody, baby momma, I ain't ask mayne  
Baby, daddy got a problem, we can hit the grass mayne  
An asshole by nature, livin' in the fast lane  
Stay rilla fo' reala, fuck with me and that's yo' ass mayne  
Honor roll student, but I dropped out of class mayne  
Ain't got a diploma, but got knots of cash mayne  
To you haters I'm a waiter waitin' to serve somebody

Don't wanna hurt nobody, just leave me the fuck alone  
Don't wanna hurt nobody but a nigga might fuck around  
And bust your brain  
  
I guess they never seen a guerilla when he stompin' and pissed  
But they 'bout to see a young guerilla, whoop, they ass with his fist  
I tried to move around, motherfuckers roachin' and shit

Asshole and ain't gon' fake it 'cause I had it by nature  
And that's the result of everywhere you go niggaz hate ya  
And I ain't trippin', I'ma catch one of them marks on the back street  
With the black heat, slugs run up like a track meet  
  
I'm an anybody killa, but everybody can get it  
Servin' suckers in neighborhoods got it crackin' like a stick  
I didn't come to hurt nobody but you bumped into mine  
But we gangsters I pull a fo' and told you po' out that wine  
If I wanted flex, I coulda got a strap at that moment  
I'd rather keep ca-cash, ca-cash, 'cause I'm already wanted  
I'm an asshole by nature, my flag's on the left side  
Gave him a pass before I stepped [Incomprehensible] side

Don't wanna hurt nobody, just get me through my day  
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just leave me the fuck alone  
Don't wanna hurt nobody but a nigga might fuck around  
And bust your brain  
  
Now I don't wanna hurt nobody, but that's a lie  
Cause it's a delight for me to bust a lip or black an eye  
Or smoke a nigga like a syrup covered black 'n' mild  
So don't fuck with me when I'm tryin' to make money stackin' piles  
Some niggaz trie to rob me before, try to jack me now  
Fuck Danny Glover, I'm the lethal weapon with maxi nine  
Can't a nigga lavish any mo'?  
Without a gang of niggaz and they kickin in his do'?  
  
And nine times out of ten it'll be one of my friends  
That'll lead me to my grave, murder me to get my ends  
Do the crime and make a cape escape from my residence  
But still show up at my funeral services 'n shit  
I ain't fin' to let it happen to me, you gon' respect me  
Ain't gon' be no bad actin' with me, homie

And I hope that God bless me, to get a platinum plack  
Ain't no turning back, once I get the stack  
Once I ain't cutting no slack, up in the game  
Said it one time, now everybody know my name

Wanted me to swang down, on another 4  
Charge twenty grand, for a show

All in they face, like a motherfucking moon  
A star, a sun and my uzi weigh a ton  
Sitting in the microphone booth, going off  
Working with the hard, working with the soft  
In the motherfucking game, stacking my change

To ride and get high to, I'm chilling in the studio  
With H-Town's finest a nigga they call Z-Ro  
So go on and bump this shit, and to all you  
Niggas who I done jacked in the game  
Fuck y'all I got my beams on your ass, right  
[Z-Ro]  
Everytime you see me I'm a different nigga, but don't worry  
About my aim, I'm consistently accurate with the trigger  
My nigga don't count your chickens 'fore they hatch  
If you owe me some feddy you better pay me I'm ignorant bout my scratch  
I don't trust nan nigga cause nothing but hate they be sending me  
Can't determine my friends from my enemies  
I done had partners that done helped me when my life was on the line  
Talking about hitting me right back I'm trying to knock this bitch down  
Putting pussy before your partners disrespecting the game  
What about you broke in them titty bars be collecting your change  
Trick, nigga with all these bitch niggas are made to bleed  
Since you giving me another reason to blaze the weed  
And I don't want to do another killing, another bid  
They've been trying to give me the crack since I was a kid  
But I remain calm, pill popping smoking and leaning if I wasn't high  
I'd leave these niggas choking and screaming  
(Chorus - 2x)  
Ooh child, things are gonna get easier  
Ooh boy things will get brighter

I keep my middle finger pointed out at all times, lyrically  
Abuse somebody in all rhymes, indodging in felonious to the small crime  
Everybody want to do a song with Ro, but none  
Of these niggas want to get down on a couple of zones with Ro  
Fuck rapping, I need some right now money, it's getting crucial  
I'll be jacking for some right now money  
Niggas ain't ready for the episodes that I supply  
PCP influenced, I'm relentless nigga you can die  
Fuck all these niggas and these white folks, I'm all alone  
No friends cause in the fucking end a nigga dies all alone  
About to meet my maker, I hope my life is right  
But it's hard to focus when killers try to murder me every night  
I guess this life is really hard now, fiending for the day that this war stops  
Pulling my pistol everytime a car stops  
Live by the sword, die by the sword, nigga my time is borrowed  
I paint this for another tomorrow  
(Chorus - 2x)  
[Z-Ro]  
I'm crucified by the media because I'm loved by the public  
Even though I'm rated number one keep your thumbs up and shove it  
They said I'm trying to sound like Pac is my confession to that  
Bitch I can't help it if I sound similar when I be stressing the fact  
See I'm gone scream it cause I mean it anything less ain't excepted  
The fact that I'm dark and I'm restless is no resort of living reckless  
Rest in peace to my niggas that got caught up in the struggle  
But I'm showing love to the niggas that don't want to see me bubble  
But I take that back, fuck you, I made it to the top ten on my own  
And every bitch in every city is singing my song  
Imagine that I use to sleep on a corner  
Even in year two triple O, fuck working I'm selling marijuana  
Pulling the bull up over my eyes you just can never tell  
But I know if I'm faking I try to rap now one of tapes gone sell  
I predicted being real by staying true to myself  
Now suicide is something I don't want to do to myself  
(talking)  
Year two tripple O, Z-Ro, the new motherfucking don  
Feel that, my nigga Cocked Strong from Sinner Tone  
Day one my nigga, knowI'msaying

Cars they smoking, with herbal incent  
Mashing horses flipping tortoise, candy up like sip  
Beat the toll for a dolla, as I smash right under  
On the passenger of me, riding underground under  
I ponder in the game, passing laws gripping grain  
Screens fall like rain, leaving puddles and stains

All my tools there's a later, for a safe place hater  
So when you see me in them streets, you best bow down

From selling yale to record sales, to fatten our pocket  
Murdering motherfuckers on wax, can't nobody can stop it  
With the checks and a black X, and a rolex make niggas check

Cause they don't love a nigga here

War is out to murder me  
I'm ready to kill, and I'm ready to die  
But have these cowards heard of me  
The rumors are real, better keep your glock cocked  
Leaving em stiffer than a statue  
Ready to defend, like a guerilla, by any  
Means that I'd murder if I have to  
Heard my homie's working as an undercover  
Ready to kiss my cheek, and earn your silver pieces  
Could it be that I've seen my last supper  
Mighty Jahova, please protect my spirit from the danger  
And I know you said you would strike down upon the  
With great vengeance and curious anger  
But don't attempt to poison your brother  
Was it nothing but the word of God  
That kept a nigga, from taking the lives of so many others  
And I'm trying to keep ways right, brothers and mothers

Filled with drama and trouble

Armed a deal, smile in my face  
And stab me in my back, when I turn around

But never approach, cause they can't fade me  
And I'll be damned if I go softly, shouldn't of crossed me  
Guerilla till I die, and I'ma blast when they come for me  
Please tell me is there a place, where my guerillas could see refuge  
Cause it seems this time we gain one, as one more elute  
Whatever the rules, whatever you choose, whatever you give, I accept  
Just let me twist up, let me smoke one for the world before my last breath  
How can I go on, how can I take away my anguish

And nobody knows my soul, so I show no fear

And I got 25's, hollin' I roll  
But they tell me to keep my head up and finish my tape  
Because its gon jam but I'm losing respect, my music can't hang  
Around Z-Ro, just till we praying, I really don't know  
All I can say, that I don't trust nobody on this earth  
Been that away, ever since my birth  
But its gotta stay that-a-away till I'm dying  
Innocent niggas, risen up out of my business  
Is something they better do, I'ma hit the I cut  
When a fucker rolling rocks, sold em up even  
Till I got rest, gotta put it down to the bullets  
Dump a lot of bullets, till the job done  
Till a nigga really want to, kill myself  
Nigga shut the fuck up, my record is spinning  
I'm really trying to feel myself  
Gotta get em all, gotta get em dead  
When I'm filling the bed, put a infrared to the head  
Everybody come up dead, better get on or get stole on  
Nigga better get on, but I just can't hold on  
Cause I'm ready to kill and I'm ready to die

Ain't got no partners cause my partners put a price on my head  
Have you ever told a lie to make the drama stop  
Watch the world you love turn against you no more family problems  
How does it feel to be the black sheep, how does it feel to  
Victimized yourself for one time and evermore after the g  
And focus on the dresser bad, liquor approaching fast  
Sitting around, waiting on death to come, watching time pass  
My life, my life, falls under the wicked and shife  
I wonder where I got to sleep tonight, my nigga, how does it feel

When your kin people done turned they back

24 years old and use to frowning daily, trying to figure out  
Who was the friend, who was the foes, you know it's bout to drive me crazy  
Mama, tell Jesus I can't handle the pressure, look at  
The way they do me down here, my vision is Z-Ro on the stretcher  
Can't I breed in peace, won't y'all leave me alone  
Like Makavelli I close my eyes and picture home  
Bout a Mo City block, a place that ain't no glocks, and it ain't no sin  
No longer watching my back for the retaliation  
How does it feel to wish that you was dead, I can  
Answer that cause many of nights my pistol's to my head  
But I'm so scared, my life, my life, 360 degrees  
Of being neglected stressing enemies, my nigga, how does it feel  
(Chorus - 2x)  
[Z-Ro]  
How does it feel, when these busters try to take your life  
Lord knows I don't want to pull my 45  
But see I'ma survive, nigga don't make me use my tool  
Get some of that bomb green from Tom 'fore I lose my cool  
How can I make to it to the top I'm like a crab in a bucket  
It got me hostile, I see my pistol grab it and bust it  
Nigga get off me, I don't love nan one of y'all  
I'm coming forward you pen and killing every one of y'all  
Call me ceaser, get em while they sleeping, I'm grim reaping  
Bust and never saw me coming left him with his blood seeping  
I'm a soldier, recognize the signs of the time  
It seems it's kill or be killed up in this stony life of mine  
Can you feel it, when it's hard to rub against a real nigga  
How does it feel, to see my blood spill my nigga  
My life, my life, feel like I'm running out of time  
Till it's over catch me running with my nine, how does it feel  
(Chorus - 4x)

I'm sick of being lied to, giving it my all, you know I tried to  
Maintain in the family is a must, I would of died to  
Do anything for my peeps  
But it seems they would rather see me sleep six feet deep  
But when I'm on my feet somebody got they hand out though  
That'll feel me broke the heat be hiding the rain watch me soke  
That's the millennium love if you can pay your way, maybe you can stay  
In the mean time they hate you everyday  
Want to see me and my baby girl break it off  
Haters'll stop they self-defense friends every ten minutes drop it's off  
When three's company and four is a crowd  
And my situation is seven everybody else can move around  
Look at your friends and your friends peeping, they burn bridges  
In they household, come into your home and try to repeat it  
Got you looking at your people meaning shit  
When it's over you're lonely talking about I should of seen that shit  
  
[Chorus - 2x]  
Take a look at my life, everybody around here so shife  
No love, no sacrifice, fellas in the street ain't acting right  
  
[Z-Ro]  
Watch your enemies dog, keep them close like your block  
Most of the ones closest to you cause they want what you got  
Long as you spending money on them and your buying the drugs  
They gone be down like four flats and ain't trying to budge  
Say they love you everytime you rolling up the doe-doe  
But when your ends don't spend they tend to leave you solo  
I know, that's why I love Z-Ro, cause ain't nobody else gone love me  
I think of myself, why'all don't think of me  
I'm all alone but guess what, that's alright  
Even though they use me for a punching bag, that's alright  
Even if my woman don't want me no more, that's alright  
I got Jesus and I can conversate with him all night  
Give me a split that's what I'm asking  
Cause I get reary ducking haters as they passing  
I wish I was a sociable person, but socializing ain't for me  
I want to die by myself in these streets cause that's love  
  
[Mr. 3-2]  
It ain't no love no more everybody about the dollar  
That's why when I pass by the G-O-V don't holler  
I pop my collar and don't follow nobody  
Keep god first and don't need no killumanati  
To put it on your mind cause I say on no pages  
Stacking big faces and travel to many places  
Sipping ski tastes straight out the gallon  
Why don't you take a lick and don't swallow ?  
The games is backstabbing, crooked it ain't right  
Friends or kin folk it don't matter we can fight  
It's whenever when we were boss want to do  
Cause I'ma pull dollar prime till I'm dead and I'm through  
  
[Chorus - 2x]  
[H2O]  
A lot of friends turn to foes over money and hoes  
I can't believe my best homie ain't my nigga no more  
Remember days of playing hookie in the streets for fun  
Now I'm getting dirty looks got me clutching my gun  
On the one, I'ma shine like the sun my nigga  
If I'm so low when I'm riding with some thugging niggas  
Family members even say that I ain't use to shit  
Cause I stay high all day straight abusing shit  
  
[Z-Ro]  
Cause lord knows Z-Ro ain't got no regular living  
Even though I'm, trying I feel as if I'm headed to prison  
Or headed to the grave, could it be I'm running out of time  
Feeling hopeless, I lost my mama then I lost my mind  
Will I heal in time, scarred up with bruise and shot  
But see the pain is in my brain, hitting like a stash spot  
My life, my life, full of drama and bullshit  
We burn this out of my foes pull quick, where the love at

Nobody seems to understand that my brain ain't stable  
They got me out on the ledge  
feel like I'm falling off the edge it ain't no fable  
It's reality, feel like I'm on the offensive, they trying to tackle me  
That's why I keep popping fists  
So rather relative or stranger, better keep your distance  
I can't determine friend or foe so you in danger  
Chemical imbalances of the weed and cocaine, but it really  
Don't matter to society, a nigga that got no face and no name  
Deserving more, but I'ma mob until I ain't got nothing left  
And the only thing that's promised to me is more problems and death  
Cause there's some niggas looking for me and they might be near  
And if they kill me don't shed a tear, remember I'm not happy here  
Even still, got to keep my eyes on the prize  
Although my vision is blurry I'm losing life in a hurry  
Even my girlfriend don't understand, didn't want to  
Witness the wicked so please find yourself another man, haters feel me  
(Chorus - 2x)  
This is my liiiiiiiiife  
Surviving in the struggle, living so shife  
[Verse 2]  
My opposition and proposition is scheming for cash  
And if you bitches is scandalous, I get in that ass  
So let's reliviate the pressure  
Don't try to run it's guaranteed these slugs'll catch you  
Oh yeah, I keeps a problem solver  
A pistol grip, a automatic and revolver  
Check it, and I'ma handle up baby  
It's in my nature it's a must it ain't a maybe, peep game  
The feds taking pictures, and tapping my phones  
But if I catch you bitches snitching best believe me it's on  
I analyze of this realize and open fire on bitches  
And if I catch you bastards slipping I'm leaving bodies in ditches, huh  
I bet that ass can pass it  
Your life span it ain't long, you in a casket, check it  
Niggas rushing your ass, mob deep with ski masks  
Busting shots on the road trying to make your car crash, this is my life  
(Chorus - 2x)  
[Z-Ro]  
These boys be telling me they got love, giving me false-i-fied tapping, but  
I know they wouldn't give a fuck about me if there wasn't no money in rapping  
See I know they want to get rich off me understand, even if I was  
To die I still can talk they still put a mic in my hand  
For trying to copy my style of life, pretending like they from my block  
While I survive on willing to live while they depend on mom and pops  
Before you make your move, check yourself and giving me for the millions  
For the love of the struggle and just can't take it cause you not real  
You want to be dead, there's gone be a dentist to see  
When a nigga be scream and hollering I'm godfather  
But I guess it's just the menace in me, plus  
The only nigga that's skipping me from clicking is Herman Fisher  
Relocated the killers and gats and drinking and if and burning swishers  
Why they want to play with my life, they got families, nigga I don't  
The only thing between me and them hoes  
Is I'ma keep thugging they timid ass won't  
Will they mind they own god damn business and keep they self out of mine  
Because of a thin line, between handling business  
and boo yeah coward a nine baby

Ooh boy things will get brighter

After living through drive-by's got a nigga ready for war  
500 push-ups everyday to keep my knock out punches up to par  
Cause everybody want to test me, knocking them down punching  
But they want to bust will I fight to jump so would the lord bless me  
To keep on breathing leaving niggas unconscience  
When I'm punching I'm going hard in the paint, so pack a lunch  
To the niggas that we killing don't feel like you the only motherfucker  
That really don't think we even love eachother  
Gorilla till I die for real murdered by my right hand man  
Or prosecuted by the white man's hand  
I don't think I'm living to die, but I'm dying to live up under the stress  
Fin to lose my cool so come out even to have you rest  
All my sins are forgiven for living violently  
With a gun in my hand, I'm creeping up on them moving silently  
They left my peope alone when my cutlass exploded on the side of the road  
The motherfuckers thought I died in the load

Am I the hunter or the most hunted  
telling my people they don't need a high to get by  
But I'm telling a lie cause I'm the most blunted  
Hard to practice my preaching when I'm under the stress  
And I'm walking around with a 12-gauge sawed off  
and a suicide note up under my vest  
I want to live in peace but drama won't allow me  
That's why my mind is gone, I'm seeing x's and tylenol three  
But do you really want to see a nigga with the vendetta  
Make everybody kill somebody I'm a trend setter  
First I was spending my time with family mobbing showing my brother's love  
Never thought it would it happen to shoot first releasing my brother's blood,
uh  
Why do these rookies want to rumble, got to do him in  
Even if he's my kin that's the only way the cookies crumble  
Calling up on your name in vain, this time I took a bow  
But if there was ever a time I needed you god I need you now, lord oh mercy  
Cause I don't wanto to die by the hands of my own kind  
Really to get true to the overdose and free my own mind, hell yeah  
(Chorus - 2x)

I no longer need the weed to reach another level, I'm on a natural high  
But I looked the devil in his eye, thinking the song I'm a survivor  
Things ain't what they seem my yellows are green  
People are demons, demons are people in my dreams, what does it mean  
I'm trying come out of this motherfucking nightmare  
Going against all odds but mama said they never fight fair  
Somebody put a price on my head for living dead  
Hoes was capping but now they in my bed, but they choosing to giving me head  
Rags to riches, sagging the creases in my breaches  
66 Impala candy dancing playing with he switches  
Finding away from righteousness and learning to sin  
You'd be the same nigga that's kicking the door with me that's turning me in  
Uh, why do the fiends buy dope from me they know they don't get high from me  
Why do the fiends buy dope from me knowing that they gone die from me  
A nigga was plexing with my partner why did he pull his gun  
Now everybody related or cool with you can die that's on my son

And even when I'm countin' off I still spit on niggaz  
No super friends I smoke purple stuff alone in my room

Mad swangas, to mo no blocks, I switch cars like socks  
Either it's somethin' with the roof missin', or a hard white top  
  
Remember me, I'm the one they laughed at in all my classes  
Now what they spend on a house I blow on designer glasses  
Even without a platinum plaque, this ain't cappin',  
I'm just tellin' you what my life like, so this ain't rappin'  
Don't you ever tell the captain, that my money ain't right  
I'm a have to pay money, to spray money, cause money ain't right  
No more throwin' no bodies, so I can stand on these streets  
I got an army behind me, cause I'm the man on these streets  
  
I did some time locked down, but now I'm back on these streets  
Here to save ya'll from all this wack rap on these streets

Not a special kind of fool, just hit her with the mule  
If she find the itch to set me up, I'll hit her with the tool  
I got a daughter to raise, I ain't tryin' to leave

Looking at my life as if I wasn't here, why the fuck that picture be so clear  
Since my nigga died, I done slowed down on drank  
But I'm right back heavy on beer  
Stained finger tips and lips, cause smoking come with murders  
Fiending for heaven but I wonder, if I'm worthy  
Please God forgive your servant, and your man child  
But the fact that he got Jordans, and a nigga like me  
Grow po' wings was bullshit, so I ran wild  
Wasn't I good enough, to get some shit like that  
It was only a grade, you know I didn't deserve to get hit like that  
My life my life, falls under the wicked and shife  
I gotta pay my rent, therefor my partnas might be targets tonight  
Even though I'm grown fucked up childhood, keep fucking my dome  
Fuck around and front, like I'm gon

The most evilest niggas nightmares, of my fondest dream  
Cause death rules everything around me and the cream, is a cup of lean  
Having a case of flashbacks, of the good time  
But then I remember, it wasn't no good time  
Just poverty stricken, and kicking it in the hood time  
24 and I still can't think, from Guerilla Maab to Point Blank

Cl'Che's looking for a thug  
You with that ladi-dadi, but I'm a hottie hottie  
Then Daz Dilinger said, you better ask somebody  
  
[Hook: x 2]  
  
[Z-Ro]  
Bitch you, ain't nothing but a greasy split  
Open your pussy hole for me, don't tease me bitch  
I'm put to put this log on you, from Michigan to Pamona  
Long as I got a rubber, Z-Ro gon bone a broad a day  
  
When I hit it, she gon injure her ankle like Hardaway  
Doggy style, come out and come back from a yard away  
Punish the panocha, I'm going south  
Do that thang with your mouth, and I'll be hard all over  
  
Look how they jock me, when I'm rocking the stage  
On that X and I'ma hit it, like I'm cocking a gauge  
I'm like em with hair down they back, or rocking the braids  
They love my dick, and want me to stay in they cot for the day  
  
But I got bidness to handle, and paper to chase  
Finish sucking my dick, and then get your ass out my face  
It ain't nothing personal, but I don't love you hoe  
You got some bomb ass pussy, but you got to go

Z-Ro,Plex,/z/z+ro/plex_20292637.html,"[Z-Ro]  
They say he was flipping out till, losing control of his mind  
Moving fast, in a world that ain't ready for the pace focussed on his grind  
Who am I to test, Z-Ro I bet everybody in Ridgemont 4 know me  
Feel what I say up under the evidence is still your homie  
You must of forgot about the days until you be in 94  
When it was 72 where partners sagging creases to find a hoe  
Now they can't look me in the eyes, cause they might tell on theyself  
About having something to do with trying to riddle my number one partner to
death  
You want to get even with me boy clear you can see me with a rap  
But I'm about gangsta shit so bow before you see me with a strap  
Cause I've been silent for so long, it's about time I broke the ice  
Nobody want to box me why everybody want to pull a trigger to take a life  
I'm down with crews cause everybody else is fake to me  
Niggas with plex against me, they all cakes to me  
And everybody want to be talking about they real and they got love  
But motherfuckers don't love Z-Ro unless I got drink and I got bud so I got
plex  
(Chorus - 2x)  
Who's next to plex you want to test  
Better have your life right in the bottle of your vest  
Cause I'm also stressed, sometimes I wonder if I'm plexed  
Thinking hit me will I have to put my homies to rest, plex  
[Z-Ro]  
Regular candy in river rain, we came to deliver pain  
One hitter quitters and eagle talons up in your liver man  
I came to bring the pain, all the way from the south to the west  
Every one of my bullets are looking residence so they gone house in your chest  
A nigga done been through so much shit the last five years of my living  
Now a days the bitches are realer than homeboys so here's to my women  
But then again I'm all alone I don't depend on a soul  
Independently made a million then I took my benz on a stroll  
Now everytime I come around my partners treat me like strangers  
Never thought it would come to this I got to keep one in the chamber  
What makes real niggas turn into hoes and make niggas go fraud  
When it comes to me whether rapping them off to see this nigga go hard  
Now everytime I come around my partners treat me like strangers  
Never thought it would come to this I got to keep one in the chamber  
What makes real niggas turn into hoes and make niggas go fraud  
When it comes to me whether rapping the gangsta shit this nigga goes hard,
plex  
(Chorus - 4x)  
Plex, time to have plex  
Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta from the barrel of me tech  
[Z-Ro]  
Rolling by my motherfucking self you don't want to plex my friend  
Fuck around with me and you might never breathe a breath again  
Cause a nigga might shoot you in a place where it takes longer to die  
And you know what they say no pain no gain  
I guess you fin to gain your heavenly high  
Marcus I see you when you shoved that pistol up in his nose  
Pulling the trigger my nigga blood was dripping all out on his clothes  
Do you think that I'm suppose to sit back and charge it to the game  
That's why your baby mama house went up in flames you know my name  
I wish I would of been strapped cause my partner would of still been alive  
I would of ran up on your ass and I would of dumped and you would of died  
Since a nigga can't change the past I'ma knock your ass up out of the future  
I use to be down to dump side by side with you but you forced me to shoot you  
Too many of these boys be bulletproof, that's why they like to compete  
But run your badass over Ridgemont you be dead before you get to Ridgecrete  
You think it's a game, but I've been working on a straight aim I'm ready to
kill  
If I can't get to myself when you want to get leid by set of bitch got skills  
(Chorus - 2x)  
Plex, time to have plex  
Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta from the barrel of me tech  
Cause I'm also stressed, sometimes I wonder if I'm blessed  
Thinking deeply will I have to put my homies to rest  
(Chorus - 4x)  
Plex, time to have plex

Haters smoking that swisha swisha sweet boy, switching damn lanes  
Pulling guns and put two in your stomach, nigga who want it  
Gangstas, if you with me gangstas  
Smoking that sticky you get pissy, riding spinners  
Tires glimmer the prize in our eyes, nigga ride with us  
Nom and Z-Ro like when Tino and DeNiro, counting Kilos in casinos  
They gambinos, for them see-notes man  
Hustlers, serving customers  
Off of his back shit cause, then we bust them guns  
  
Up jumps the boogie, cause the track is so thoed  
Got me breaking down bubble gum, I'm fin to be so blowed  
Nothing but clouds in the sky, but it's still sunny  
Cause I'm puffing on some good green, pocket full of money  
Southside, I'm wrecking for where I lay my head at  
Disrespect me, you the nigga I'ma spray my lead at  
I'm living for today, don't give a fuck about tomorrow  
I'm robbing you motherfuckers, it ain't no need to borrow  
Money from dad, that nigga wouldn't lend me no cash  
Seventeen he threw me out, like the trash  
It's all gravy baby, I'm connected with the street my mama Ridgevan  
And daddy East and West, Cancel Creek the dopefiends love me  
I got a cousin, named Mard  
Everytime I bring him outside, suckers be running up in my yard  
Smartest thing I got is a 20, and you could get a whole sale  
If you want it soft, let me run back to the motel  
  
Running to the ceiling, what it's fin to be  
Blowing cigarillos, no more swisha sweet  
But regular weed, a gangsta fa sho I am

Flipping in a four do', trying to get some mo' do'

Z-Ro,Remember Me,/z/z+ro/remember+me_20713221.html,"Hell yeah nigga, ay yo  
  
[Z-Ro:]  
Remember me, when I use to write my rhymes in class  
At Dick Dall Middle School, all them niggaz would laugh  
Telling me I would never make it, cause I rap too fast  
I was desperately trying to find out, how to go from scraps to cash  
Remember, how y'all use to chase me home from school  
Just cause I sported corduroy britches, and Pro Wing shoes  
I use to have a lunch card, cause them times was hard  
Since the seven people living in one house, with no cars in the yard  
I remember stressing so hard, I couldn't keep my focus  
My only love was for extras, and overs  
Fuck all you niggaz, don't make me slap the fuck out all you niggaz  
If it ain't related to making paper, I ain't calling you niggaz  
I bet Mo City remember, when I took it over with rapping  
51-11 Ridgevan, moving that crack bitch I was stacking  
Residuals redeemingly, I was raw mayn raw caine  
Rapidly running my neighborhood, I was the law mayn  
'Member when I dropped my first album, in '98  
Fucking with Herman Fisher, but now that nigga hate me he's a cake  
Suppose to be mad at me, tal'n bout I owe him some change  
Nigga just mad cause they can't eat with me, I eat with Lil' James  
Rap-A-Lot Mafia my man, y'all remember the Maab  
This isn't Den-Den and Z-Ro, y'all better remember the squad  
Two different labels but the same cable, remember we connected  
Woodfair to Missouri City, two block of Screwed Up Texas  
  
[Hook: x2]  
Remember me, I'm the one they laughed at in all my classes  
They use to rank on my low budget clothes, and my glasses  
Remember me, the same one they use to call egghead  
Now I play with fed bread, and sleep on Gucci bed spreads  
  
[P.O.P.:]  
I remember the winters in the hood, no heat cold nights  
No gas no lights, a ghetto low life  
So my flow twice as strong, from the memories  
I remember when my closest homies, turned to enemies  
See niggaz tend to be, down when your bread up  
But when you in the quicksand, they frown cause your legs stuck  
Yeah I remember that, so you remember this  
Hard times be my fuel, so I ain't finna quit  
I vividly, R-E-M-E-M-B-E-R  
Craig up in the E-R, bloody getting CPR  
So before, the reaper come and turn me to a memory  
I endlessly spit the heat, for the people to remember me  
Me P.O.P., so many forgot bout  
But not I, this for those who remember little Popeye  
And I remember hot guys, ridiculed the flow  
Now I'm front and center nigga, haters finna do me so  
  
[Hook x2]  
  
[Bun B:]  
Shit I remember back in the game, it was tough  
No matter what a nigga had, it was never enough  
See if I had five I wanted ten, and if I had ten I wanted twenty  
Fuck having some, shit I wanted plenty  
Back in the gap, when I first hit the block  
With my first 25, and a hand full of rocks  
Posted up at Samantha house on the West, on the porch  
Ready to give my nigga some work, or give him the torch  
I remember telling my T, I wasn't going to college  
And was headed to the streets, to get the rest of my knowledge  
That broke her heart, and for that I had to go  
So I went from the sidelines, to starring in the show  
Everything came slow, and nothing came fast  
Most times I was out of luck, and dead on my ass  
But with the heart of a hustler, and the mind of a G  
I came up, now I'm something to see Bun B

Unstoppable, feel me, yeah

Ain't nothing but a g thang baby  
Turnel sets dried yellow bones crazy  
Can't fade me, died lately  
Pulling out the escallade or a mercedes  
Trunk popper, show stopper, drank sipper  
Rule number one is to never tip a stripper  
And I know a lot of why'all want to wish me trouble  
Went from swanging hoo-doos to a bentley bubble  
Image is everything, diamonds in every ring  
Piece and chains that hang down low to my dang-a-lang  
Stop that, cop that, I'm a baller baby  
Got the rims that poke out on the prowler baby  
I'm the same young cat that dropped the jewels on them  
Next year I'm about to drop 22's on them  
From the Mo to the Fo, back to airport landing  
Diamonds speak for theyself, Flex so outstanding

Still standing, and you know we represent the south  
And ya know ya know we represent the south  
Still standing, we in the door and these haters can't keep us out

Off the heezy, fa sheezy I'm breezy

Believe me, outstanding with my family  
From me and Z-Ro and Lil' Flex at the grammy  
Boss player from Texas, you could tell by the necklace  
We gone break these hoes on four's now we frozen the Lexus  
My protected, move around, get around  
Come through show some round when we hit your town  
It go down, whoa now, school slow down  
Watch these fours roll down crawl down your block  
Top drop, trunk knock, glock cocked  
And these shops gone bop, it don't stop  
Won't stop, how it go down  
Harm clock, Mo City, south west still shine, wooo

Screwed up representer these fellas don't want none  
From the land of the trunk poppers where ballers blow tons  
We stacking funds, and living our life out on the run  
In search of a platinum plack trying to get stacks it just begun  
If you talking down move around we ain't having that  
East and West took it before but see we came to grab it back  
Can't see us like cataracts, off in our natural habitat  
That's the studio and bro you know ain't no more selling crack  
Ain't nothing but rocking trash talking on down to the ain't that  
Cause I'm a veteran to this here ever since the days of the Wave Band  
When I was knee high to a grass hopper but now we roll on chppers  
Me and Gene hovering over the ground in candy helicopters  
Now we platinum status without driving a dodge stratus  
Keeping it gangsta energy instinct with a heater to protect us  
Man it's third coast, to me our music mean the most  
Big Mello and Lil' Flex and Z-Ro the crooked as your folks and we

One time, I keep my head up even though I feel like giving up  
Sometimes, Keep your head up trying to find sunshine

Man what happened to the sun on my lawn it's so gloomy and grey  
I got a feeling 5-O gone try to do me today  
Nothing but backstreets for me cause I don't need a vacation  
Looking for front run up that seem the only compensation  
The hood is on fire, other soldiers won't let it down  
They ain't set tripping but out here jacking has been alive  
Misery spinning what they clicking for no reason at all  
Even intentions of stacking paper they pleasing them all  
And outside, smelling like nothing but formaldrahide  
It's an everyday suicide, R.I.P. to the ones that died  
Wake up before you get caught up don't keep on selling your soul  
Until your life fall up, you got to try to find

We living in a world that's dirty and so shife  
You trying to figure out this the game that's called life  
These days is cold and got me searching for my soul  
Like paper bags and lawn chairs man you unfold  
I'm looking out my window for some, sunshine  
I'm trying to give it up cause I swear it's my time  
I five petreat and start thinking about my sins  
Roll up another square and start thinking about the benz  
Talent and skills is what I'm bringing  
New homes and microphones got the cell phone ringing  
Push play on the deck, to let my mind collect  
And try to mash on the gas with no time to sweat  
This the ghetto, and that's all I know  
Another episode from the young don and Ro  
If the family is tight, then everything's alright  
So quick to catch flight for the sunlight, uh

Seem like I can't stand the rain prosecution and struggle up in my brain  
Got to tell me slow down if you can see all of my veins  
Cause I ain't having none of that riff raff to get back and blood  
Keep my enemy close to me cause your killer be your 'cause  
I wish I was, able to socialize with why'all  
Instead of trading war stories and taking lies from why'all  
It's how it be though, Lil' Keke and Z-Ro we on the grind  
Long as they talking about us, we know we staying on they mind  
Don't hate us congratulate us, why why'all turning up why'all nose  
Cause it's been we be spittng straight be burning up why'all glow  
Want to take it away from pin and pad and pick up a gun  
You better repent my dog it's over, you done better try to find

Soldier that's what I be, so bitch  
Why you trying to play me like a H-O-E  
Turn me loose so I can make it to the T-O-P  
It's like I'm in a bucket full of see-are-A-be 's, but I keep climbing  
And I keep on rhyming, while they be bumping they gums  
Looking at my diamonds whining and blinding, no dumping they guns

Thugged off in my kitchen, cutting chemicals in my cakes

Talk down on me in front of me, but not behind my gat  
I bet you won't do that, I bet you scared of that iron  
Perpetrating like you a gorilla, selling drinks in line  
You ain't never seen the Pen nigga, the penitentiary  
They talk rehabilitation, but look at what it did to me  
I smoke mo' and sip mo', than ever before  
Motherfuckers be on my nerves, so I lean on that dro  
Trying to keep on dropping a bomb, on the bitch-made  
Don't be looking surprised, y'all made it this way  
I got a Vendetta with lifts, that be trying to sink me  
Sending police after me, and trying to link me  
To aggravated robbery, and strong-arm jacking  
Trying to throw me off my note, so I can't do no stacking

Looking for niggas that was plotting on receiving my mail

How are we gonna get the rent paid and the  
Motherfucking bills paid, knowI'msaying  
You got to cover my eyes remember

Baby stay down with me through thick and thin, and I promise it's gonna pay
off  
Though hurts you like a sailor cause baby you need to stay soft  
You took me on a ride, without no breaks to mash  
The things you do it make the average nigga hate your ass  
But I just love it when you cuss at a nigga, when it's all good  
In the bed when your finger nails clutching a nigga  
You said you'd always be there, and not to worry about a thang  
But when I started to struggle you left a nigga to hang  
What kind of shit is when you want to see your woman tonight  
On top of that there was no food, phone, water or lights  
I had a state be thought of suicide, nobody could move it  
You took the pistol from my head when I attempted to do it  
Baby I know that I be tripping sometimes  
It's just because I never owned anything that's mine  
Understand my situation and be patient and we'll make it in the end  
Want you to be the first to ride around in my benz

And I, won't keep on hogging you  
Even though you're the only girl I'm talking to  
I'm in it to win it and I don't want to lose

I should of beeped you to apologize but I guess I changed  
Cause I be feeling like you wanted to end  
Don't want to be your enemy baby, but I can't be your friend  
Female associates are gone, miss, I loved you  
And treated your kid as if he was my own kid  
So if you think I was affatuated, bet one hundred see-notes  
That I show you what it is to be broke  
When I was ready to misbehave and get paid, my nigga run at me now  
Knew it was peticular car cause I got you on my mind  
Even all the days of my life I want you staying with me  
But the way it's been it don't get gravy until you laying with me  
Cause we be at eachother's thugs like we were crypts and bloods  
Always the first to say I'm sorry grab your hips and shove

Now I get promenade in an escallade, and be low keyed in my cheve  
Now you looking like you want to curse  
Never put trust in the woman or a nigga, only put trust in my verse  
Cause if it is well then I'll understand  
if you ain't helping me making you could find another man  
I'll get my pen and she is number one in my state  
Got ladies looking from me head to chest then the navel  
Willing and abel to be dedicated from the heart  
Must of mistaken me for yourself that's why I cheated from the start  
Freaky in the dark, baby I bet I make you cum

Whenever you feel that pressure  
You let em know everyday of your life is, check it

Proof I'm ballin', I put a eighth  
Of that white down in my hood, I can finish it by the mornin'  
Re-up by noon, re-kick at night  
Half these dudes doing bids couldn't live my life  
And you youngn's in the hood want to be like P  
Cause every new gat I cop it begin wit a P  
Like, P-89 you niggas' P-92 shit

Hoes get at 'em when they see a nigga ballin'  
Keep the steel wit me, couple of killas from the hood

We ride out (and?) we find out (where?)  
Your little address (and?) blow out your hideout (yeah)  
Who want war? hoes they tellin' me ""E's you ain't right""

This for them haters think I'm slippin', I ain't  
When I find 'em hiding I tie 'em, they be missin' like weight  
But wait, lil nigga don't be missin' my point  
I don't miss when I point, niggas get killed off point  
And you see, I school a little you, forfeit the game

Cast a-sea so long ago was a message from my father.  
  
You keep your heart above your head and your eyes wide open  
So this world can't find a way to leave you cold  
And know you're not the only ship out on the ocean  
Save your strength for things that you can change  
Forgive the ones you can't

And all the places that I ended up not the way Ma woulda had it

And when a pony he comes riding by you better set your sweet ass on it  
  
And keep your heart above your head and you eyes wide open

And know you're not the only ship out on the ocean  
Save your strength for things that you can change  
Forgive the ones you can't  
You gotta let it go

And like the fear that grabs a hold ya let it go  
La la la la la la (let it go, let it go) let it go  
La la la la la la (let it go, let it go) let it go  
  
You keep your heart above your head and you eyes wide open  
So this world can't find a way to leave you cold

When he almost took an eyeball from Lonny's son  
And I was sitting at home making fig preserves  
And I'd seen where that rooster kicked him in the eye  
And I knew that that was the day that chicken was going to get what he
deserved  
  
So I chased the chicken  
I chased the chicken  
I chased the chicken and Pete hit 'em from the side  
  
I chased the chicken  
I chased the chicken  
I chased the chicken and me and Pete suppered on a home made chicken pot pie

At the helm insanity, if you'd look Mama

Fall apart, engine's burnin'

Zao,All Else Failed,/z/zao/all+else+failed_10198431.html,"(A throne in Heaven sat empty for 33 years.) Why? For what do we strive that
will bring us closer. No human deed will show us approved. For two thousand
years we've chokedon our efforts. Only tolay down and die. Things change, and
things stay the same. Through all these trials I cannot compose myself. Till
there is a time no heaviness fills my heart. I canot compose myself. So in all
this, there must arise a plan. A strategy to subdue the schemes. For
generation upon generation God retained a silence that shattered the hearts of
men. And for a season, all else failed. There is no other name, given among
men whereby they might be saved. In all these years when men crawled the earth
choking on his tears, no composure, nor completion reigned. No self righteous
cleansing. Leaning on the strength of self or another man... No human effort
can bring holyness or even the strength to stand. There is  
no explanation for this reasoning. The only thing in life that is constant is
Jesus.

Lifting my spirit once again, sinking not in my functioning.  
Inhale, exhale this over and over again.  
Looking for tomorrow forgetting about today.  
Dying, dying.  
Through prayer and sacrifice into all the earth,  
With love and understanding.  
Now I look to importance, standing here steadfast,  
To renew (the? or Your?) spirit within me.  
Do not cast me from Your presence,  
Or take Your Holy Spirit from me

When every thing is silent

In these times of silence,

I find there is a void that rises up,  
A peace that brings my tears,  
A comfort that no one else can offer.

And base their self on opinions

Children at school  
Candies in their mouth  
Blue swimming pools  
Facing the south  
Golden countries  
Inhabited by fairies  
Moonlight fading in the rising sun  
No need to fight, I'm out of the run  
I'm loosing control

Growing up sad

Deep in my soul

To hurt mum  
A strange shot  
When dad is gone

Leaning over

Game over

And when an animal can't find shelter

From the outside looking in we shout the anthem of our lives  
Come on and let me go  
And just like everyone else  
I feel the pain each time I try  
But I'll fight the bitter end  
To shout the anthem  
The anthem of our lives  
  
I got a heartache  
She's my insecurity  
I got all these on my tongue but they escape me  
I want to breakout, carpe diem,  
I know, but all this doubt in my head It won't let me go  
  
Can't you see I want to find my own direction on this busy one-way street  
Where all the influential people never bother helping me  
  
Get up! Get up!  
Let the good times roll  
Get up! Get up!  
Take my heart and my soul!  
Get up! Get up!  
Let the good times roll  
One and on and on  
  
Feel like everyone else just needs to see through different eyes  
From the outside looking in we shout the anthem of our lives  
Come on and let me go  
And just like everyone else  
I feel the pain each time I try  
But I'll fight the bitter end  
To shout the anthem  
The anthem of our lives  
  
This is the anthem  
Out to all the misfits  
If you feel you don't belong  
If you don't give a shit  
About authority  
About majority  
About conformity  
Shout it out  
Let us go!  
Let us go!  
Let us go!  
Let us go!  
Let us go!  
Let us go!  
Let us go!  
  
Everyone else just needs to see through different eyes  
From the outside looking in  
We shout the anthem of our lives  
Just like everyone else  
I feel the pain each time I try  
But I'll fight the bitter end  
To shout the anthem  
The anthem of our lives

Pardon me, but if you really want to know it

'Cause their colors lost their place  
And now they're dripping down and bleeding  
  
And they're running and running away

Like a promise with no meaning

You might as well forget it

This war will never end  
Be careful what you wish for  
You just might get it, get it, get it  
You just might get it, get it, get it, so hold tight

I don't know what I like better  
Being comatose or just being with her  
Here she comes to point her fingers down at me  
With all ten of her personalities  
I don't know what I like better  
Saying goodbye or saying that I hate her.  
Stab your dagger right through my heart and twist

Has nothing to do with you

Like ocean size  
From the blood your needle drew  
And I apologize  
But my demise  
  
Has everything to do with you  
Settle up with the devil  
Close the basement door  
Full force on the shovel  
And unearth the floor  
You were there one day  
But you're here no more  
Like a stroke through the heart  
  
And you play the whore  
'Cause you stole my soul  
Kleptomaniac  
Now I can hate myself take my anger back  
  
Love is a violent attack  
You cut me down  
I feel no pain now  
This nightmare is almost through  
  
I hit the ground  
No need to feel now  
My time here is all but done  
All but done  
Now I'm up in the attic  
Where the rafter's strong  
So many reasons to be tragic  
  
And the list is long  
If you think I've lost hope  
You were never wrong  
'Cause the churning of the rope  
Is my battle song  
  
Settle up with the devil  
Close the basement door  
Full force on the shovel  
And unearth the floor  
  
You we're there one day  
But you're here no more  
Like a stake through the heart  
And you play the whore  
  
'Cause you burned my soul  
Pyromaniac  
You can hate yourself take your anger back  
Love is a violent attack  
I can't stand on my own feet now  
  
I can't crawl forever and a day  
Felt like I was getting stronger  
Before you turned and walked away  
I apologize

I wish the picture on the wall would still say it all  
But now yesterday is so far away  
And I would give anything, say anything  
  
To keep it all like it was  
But you just throw it all away  
And I think this house is not my home  
I think that I'd rather be alone tonight  
I'm trying, trying to fake it  
  
I'm tired, so tired, of giving up and taking all the blame  
I wish the shouting and the fights would stop for the night  
Can't close my eyes and make them all go away  
And I would give anything, say anything  
To keep it all like it was  
But you just throw it all away

This is the part where you say  
You can't stay together just for me  
This is the part where you make me choose  
On whose side I want to be  
This is the part where you decide  
What's going to be best for me  
This is the start  
Now we grow apart  
Now we grow apart

Bonded together we can share in the pain  
And we can feel it, believe it, timing is everything  
And this time we're going out with a bang

Right now, fight for a new beginning  
Right now, ignite and light the shape of the world you're living

Bleed for liberty and get machines to rage

And I know that she won't let me down

I know a girl who wakes up my world  
Brings in the warmth when I'm feeling cold  
And she's got places to be  
But she says that she would rather stay here with me  
And I've found that when I'm on the ground  
She's the only one sticking around  
Only she knows the real me  
And I know that she won't let me down

Can you make me shine?  
Can you shake the dust and make me shine  
Like they do in sheffield all the time?  
Been everywhere around the world,  
Seen every, every kind of girl, yeah.  
But it moves me the way that I think I know,  
And it weakens me, so make your loving flow.  
Can you shake the dust from off my shoes -
